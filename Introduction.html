<p class="custom">
This is an example of a specially styled paragraph.
</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, dear reader!</p>
<p>This book is a sequel to the first book, ‘Meet Dameo!’ That time we
got to know the game, and now we are planning a deeper dive into it.</p>
<p>The idea of the second book is to show the beauty and
inexhaustibility of this game, the intentions and plans of the sides,
and the originality of the players’ thinking through examples of whole
games or long fragments of them. Consistency in carrying out the plans
of the players and a vivid battle of minds constitute the beauty of any
intellectual game.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to comment on Dameo games because of the huge
number of moves and variants. Only a computer program can handle such a
massive amount, but we are not going to complain and will try to study
and understand this little-explored game more deeply by means of
ordinary human manual analysis.</p>
<p>We assume that the reader is already familiar with Dameo’s rules, but
we will still briefly describe them. Sufficiently experienced players
can skip this description and proceed to the next chapter.</p>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<p>So, the rules of Dameo are to a certain extent the same as the rules
of international draughts, but there are three major differences,
namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>a simple checker moves forward in three directions; a king moves in
8 directions, like a queen in Chess to any available number of
cells.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>a simple checker may jump over one or more other checkers of its own
colour, provided that the field ahead is free; the king does not
participate in a line jump (red arrows below on the diagram).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>all captures in Dameo are straight (orthogonal) only; a simple
checker may capture forward, backward, or sideways by the short leap; a
king may capture by the long leap.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>All three differences are shown in diagrams 1a, 1b and 1c.</p>
<p>The rest of the rules (the rule of majority capture, the rule of
Turkish strike) coincide with the rules of international draughts.</p>
<p>1a <img src="diagrams/1a.svg" class="diagram" alt="1a" /></p>
<p>1b <img src="diagrams/1b.svg" class="diagram" alt="1b" /></p>
<p>1c <img src="diagrams/1c.svg" class="diagram" alt="1c" /></p>
<p>An important distinguishing feature of Dameo is the fact that two
kings always defeat a lone king. Due to this, you will win with even a
small advantage. This leads to a high percentage of decisive games
compared to international draughts, which tends to draw in high level
play. The construction of the winning position is shown in the first
book in the chapter ‘Two kings against one’.</p>
<p>Well, that’s the end of the introductory part and let’s move on to
the main content.</p>
<h2 id="game-1">GAME №1</h2>
<p>Beginner_2017 vs Busybee Tournament: draughts.cv.DAMEO.16.1.1<br />
2023</p>
<p>Games against player Busybee are always difficult but memorable.
Busybee is probably the strongest Dameo player but he also has
outstanding results in other games. For example, Busybee has a 100% win
rate in such complex games as Shogi and Lines of Action. Of course, I
would like to believe that he is a human and not a bot but unfortunately
he hasn’t desire to start a dialogue or respond to a greeting. No
problems, but it’s a thousand pities. The point is that it is always
nice to come across something unexplainable and genius, because it is an
unforgettable experience for us ordinary people.</p>
<p>Our meeting had everything: a very complex opening, inventive play
from both sides, nonobvious mistakes and nonobvious punishment for them,
and a cascade of combination hits.</p>

<p>Black plays ingratiatingly and is not in a hurry. In fact, Busybee
made the move g8g6 in two stages. In Chess, such a loss of time often
leads to bad consequences in the opening, but Dameo allows you to
regulate the pace of your development.</p>

<p>White also made the move e1e4 in two stages. I just decided to not
rush either and see the opponent’s intentions. White builds up its
forces in the centre and isn’t afraid of penetration by the opponent on
the field h4:</p>

</figure>
<p>White has a small advantage in development, as well as 6 pieces
against 4 on its right flank. Take note that White removed the black
checker f6 to avoid the exchange g6g5. In this case Black would have
strengthened on the vertical ‘h’.<br />
All of the above doesn’t mean that White has a clear advantage, just it
would be clear and easy for me to play in such a position. Next, I would
plan to accumulate forces on verticals ‘g’ and ‘h’, planning an attack
and breakthrough on the right flank.<br />
Again I emphasise that Black’s position is quite good, I just like to
play with clear guidelines. In this case it is an attack by White’s
checkers on the right flank.</p>
<p>Since Busybee refused this variant, I decided to take the h4 field
myself.</p>

<p>Possessing excellent combinational vision, Busybee often gives away
the edge vertical, but constructs similar fists of checkers and sets
endless traps.<br />
Now it is impossible to go to the field h5 due to the uncomplicated
strike:</p>
<div class="variation">

</figure>
<p>Despite the material equality, White’s position is worse due to the
weakness of the right flank. Black’s attack on the line ‘h’ is very
dangerous.</p>
<p>I decided not to hurry and first closed the field f2.</p>

</figure>
<p>The position escalates with each move. Now, when White has already
closed the hole f2, I really wanted to play 7.h4h5. Of course, Black has
many answers, it’s impossible to consider them all, but from a logical
point of view there are two continuations.<br />
Let’s consider each of them.</p>
<p><code>А)</code></p>

<p>A splinter like that is hard to tolerate, so:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Diagram 7</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During the game I saw this position in my mind and considered it as
favourable for White. Why? I thought that I could continue the attack on
the right flank by quickly moving forces there (d1g4, f2h4, e2h5). This
plan is clear and understandable, so it’s easier to play this way.<br />
But Black has a second continuation:</p>
<p><code>B)</code></p>
<div class="variation">

</div>
<table>

<tr class="odd">
<td>7.</td>
<td>h4h5</td>
<td>g6g4!?</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>This answer leads to puzzling complications that are impossible for a
human to figure out. Therefore, I didn’t risk going for this
continuation against a master of combination play like Busybee. What
follows is possible:</p>
<div class="variation">

</div>

</figure>
<p>In this position the variants are useless, because they are
inexhaustible. I feared the binding of my centre by b8e5, and the march
of my two pieces on the vertical ‘h’ is broken by the h8 piece. I didn’t
believe that I would get the king and be able to save it.<br />
So I decided to prepare more thoroughly an attack on the right extreme
line (back to diagram 6).</p>

<p>Black still binds White’s centre, but in an unusual way. Obviously,
Busybee provokes me, leaving a hole on the f6. But what did he come up

<p>What? B6b5?? I wasn’t expecting this move at all. I would never have
come up with it! Despite the sign ‘?!’, the move b6b5 is absolutely
grandiose in its plan, but the problem is that I found an unexpected

A crazy combination idea! I must confess that during the game I didn’t

counter-attack and the hunter would become the fowl!<br />

<p>I thought that the advantage in development and the twofold
superiority in forces on the right flank would give me an excellent
chance of victory. This is true, but White’s position has one
disadvantage: the pieces are still fragmented and, as a consequence,
have little interaction. With this in mind, Busybee carries out a plan
with a sharp build-up of forces in the centre to attack White’s most
vulnerable area between the flanks.</p>

<p>White decided that it was time to take action after consolidating his
forces. I convinced myself that neither e5f4 nor d6f4 is dangerous for
me. In addition, c7f4 isn’t valid, because at the end of the variant the
g5 piece gets on the c7 square with two extra pieces.</p>

<p>Even though there are equal pieces on both sides, Black’s position is
won as Busybee can get 2 kings. One of them dies in the a1—c1 trap, but
the other survives.<br />
This was clear enough to me, but only a few players know my character.
In lost positions I often play the strongest.<br />
It’s easy to play when everything on the board is good for you, but how
hard it is to gather yourself at a critical moment and find a chain of
the best moves with the faint hope for a draw! Perhaps my innate
optimism helps me in this regard. Anyway, out of all the games I won, I
had a very bad position in 30% of them.<br />
So, let’s look at the diagram.<br />
Firstly, we need to prevent Black from getting 2 kings. To do this, we
take control of the f3 square.</p>

<p>Take note of Black’s last move. This is a very multidimensional move.
Checker f6 goes to help checker e4 to make a breakthrough on the field
f3. But why didn’t Black play d6e5 for this purpose? Then Busybee would
save 1 tempo! But the d6 piece should go to c5 and close the c6 piece if
White gets a king on c8. In this case White’s king is caught by the way
g8h7.</p>
<p>Given this reasoning, I concluded that it is necessary to attack the
black pieces on the last row to destroy the trap for the future king on
c8.</p>
