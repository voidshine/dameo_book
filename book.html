<p>(This is a placeholder title. Edit away!)</p>
<p class="custom">
This is an example of a specially styled paragraph.
</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, dear reader!</p>
<p>This book is a sequel to the first book, ‘Meet Dameo!’ That time we
got to know the game, and now we are planning a deeper dive into it.</p>
<p>The idea of the second book is to show the beauty and
inexhaustibility of this game, the intentions and plans of the sides,
and the originality of the players’ thinking through examples of whole
games or long fragments of them. Consistency in carrying out the plans
of the players and a vivid battle of minds constitute the beauty of any
intellectual game.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to comment on Dameo games because of the huge
number of moves and variants. Only a computer program can handle such a
massive amount, but we are not going to complain and will try to study
and understand this little-explored game more deeply by means of
ordinary human manual analysis.</p>
<p>We assume that the reader is already familiar with Dameo’s rules, but
we will still briefly describe them. Sufficiently experienced players
can skip this description and proceed to the next chapter.</p>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<p>So, the rules of Dameo are to a certain extent the same as the rules
of international draughts, but there are three major differences,
namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>a simple checker moves forward in three directions; a king moves in
8 directions, like a queen in Chess to any available number of
cells.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>a simple checker may jump over one or more other checkers of its own
colour, provided that the field ahead is free; the king does not
participate in a line jump (red arrows below on the diagram).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>all captures in Dameo are straight (orthogonal) only; a simple
checker may capture forward, backward, or sideways by the short leap; a
king may capture by the long leap.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>All three differences are shown in diagrams 1a, 1b and 1c.</p>
<p>The rest of the rules (the rule of majority capture, the rule of
Turkish strike) coincide with the rules of international draughts.</p>
<p>1a <img src="diagrams/1a.svg" alt="1a" /></p>
<p>1b <img src="diagrams/1b.svg" alt="1b" /></p>
<p>1c <img src="diagrams/1c.svg" alt="1c" /></p>
<p>An important distinguishing feature of Dameo is the fact that two
kings always defeat a lone king. Due to this, you will win with even a
small advantage. This leads to a high percentage of decisive games
compared to international draughts, which tends to draw in high level
play. The construction of the winning position is shown in the first
book in the chapter ‘Two kings against one’.</p>
<p>Well, that’s the end of the introductory part and let’s move on to
the main content.

<h2 id="game-1">GAME №1</h2>
<p>Beginner_2017 vs Busybee littlegolem.net Tournament:
draughts.cv.DAMEO.16.1.1 2023</p>
<p>Games against player Busybee are always difficult but memorable.
Busybee is probably the strongest Dameo player but he also has
outstanding results in other games. For example, Busybee has a 100% win
rate in such complex games as Shogi and Lines of Action. It is always
nice to come across something unexplainable and genius, because it is an
unforgettable experience for us ordinary people.</p>
<p>Our meeting had everything: a very complex opening, inventive play
from both sides, nonobvious mistakes and nonobvious punishment for them,
and a cascade of combination hits.</p>

<p>Black plays ingratiatingly and is not in a hurry. In fact, Busybee
made the move g8g6 in two stages. In Chess, such a loss of time often
leads to bad consequences in the opening, but Dameo allows you to
regulate the pace of your development.</p>

<p>White also made the move e1e4 in two stages. I just decided to not
rush either and see the opponent’s intentions. White builds up its
forces in the centre and isn’t afraid of penetration by the opponent on
the field h4:</p>

</figure>
<p>White has a small advantage in development, as well as 6 pieces
against 4 on its right flank. Take note that White removed the black
checker f6 to avoid the exchange g6g5. In this case Black would have
strengthened on the vertical ‘h’. All of the above doesn’t mean that
White has a clear advantage, just it would be clear and easy for me to
play in such a position. Next, I would plan to accumulate forces on
verticals ‘g’ and ‘h’, planning an attack and breakthrough on the right
flank. Again I emphasise that Black’s position is quite good, I just
like to play with clear guidelines. In this case it is an attack by
White’s checkers on the right flank.</p>
<p>Since Busybee refused this variant, I decided to take the h4 field
myself.</p>

<p>Possessing excellent combinational vision, Busybee often gives away
the edge vertical, but constructs similar fists of checkers and sets
endless traps. Now it is impossible to go to the field h5 due to the
uncomplicated strike:</p>

</figure>
<p>Despite the material equality, White’s position is worse due to the
weakness of the right flank. Black’s attack on the line ‘h’ is very
dangerous.</p>
<p>I decided not to hurry and first closed the field f2.</p>

<p>The position escalates with each move. Now, when White has already
closed the hole f2, I really wanted to play 7.h4h5. Of course, Black has
many answers, it’s impossible to consider them all, but from a logical
point of view there are two continuations. Let’s consider each of
them.</p>
<p><code>А)</code></p>

</figure>
<p>During the game I saw this position in my mind and considered it as
favourable for White. Why? I thought that I could continue the attack on
the right flank by quickly moving forces there (d1g4, f2h4, e2h5). This
plan is clear and understandable, so it’s easier to play this way. But
Black has a second continuation:</p>

<div class="variation">

<p>This answer leads to puzzling complications that are impossible for a
human to figure out. Therefore, I didn’t risk going for this
continuation against a master of combination play like Busybee. What
follows is possible:</p>

</figure>
<p>In this position the variants are useless, because they are
inexhaustible. I feared the binding of my centre by b8e5, and the march
of my two pieces on the vertical ‘h’ is broken by the h8 piece. I didn’t
believe that I would get the king and be able to save it. So I decided
to prepare more thoroughly an attack on the right extreme line (back to
diagram 6).</p>

<p>What? B6b5?? I wasn’t expecting this move at all. I would never have

counter-attack and the hunter would become the fowl! Let’s go back to

<p>I thought that the advantage in development and the twofold
superiority in forces on the right flank would give me an excellent
chance of victory. This is true, but White’s position has one
disadvantage: the pieces are still fragmented and, as a consequence,
have little interaction. With this in mind, Busybee carries out a plan
with a sharp build-up of forces in the centre to attack White’s most
vulnerable area between the flanks.</p>

<p>White decided that it was time to take action after consolidating his
forces. I convinced myself that neither e5f4 nor d6f4 is dangerous for
me. In addition, c7f4 isn’t valid, because at the end of the variant the
g5 piece gets on the c7 square with two extra pieces.</p>
<p>This is true, but the intention to outsmart Busybee in the

<p>Even though there are equal pieces on both sides, Black’s position is
won as Busybee can get 2 kings. One of them dies in the a1—c1 trap, but
the other survives. This was clear enough to me, but only a few players
know my character. In lost positions I often play the strongest. It’s
easy to play when everything on the board is good for you, but how hard
it is to gather yourself at a critical moment and find a chain of the
best moves with the faint hope for a draw! Perhaps my innate optimism
helps me in this regard. Anyway, out of all the games I won, I had a
very bad position in 30% of them. So, let’s look at the diagram.
Firstly, we need to prevent Black from getting 2 kings. To do this, we
take control of the f3 square.</p>

<p>Take note of Black’s last move. This is a very multidimensional move.
Checker f6 goes to help checker e4 to make a breakthrough on the field
f3. But why didn’t Black play d6e5 for this purpose? Then Busybee would
save 1 tempo! But the d6 piece should go to c5 and close the c6 piece if
White gets a king on c8. In this case White’s king is caught by the way
g8h7.</p>
<p>Given this reasoning, I concluded that it is necessary to attack the
black pieces on the last row to destroy the trap for the future king on
c8.</p>

<p>White gave up. 0:2.</p>
<p>Well… Despite losing, I really enjoyed fighting in this game. After
all, beauty is above all, and I’m glad that I created it with my
partner.<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"></p>
<h2 id="game-2">GAME №2</h2>
<p>Ray Garrison vs Beginner_2017 littlegolem.net Tournament:
draughts.cv.DAMEO.5.1.1 2018</p>
<p>Sometimes I come across games that are impossible to analyse because
of Dameo’s infinity. Yes, sure, I can dive deep enough, but the
abundance of variants and continuations discourages me.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to tell you about one such game. It will be a long
story, but I’d like the reader to fully feel that an ordinary 8x8 board
can be like a cosmos with infinite stars.</p>
<p>My meetings at the board with Ray Garrison are often of a memorable
character. Ray is a very pleasant partner and conversationalist; he
reads a lot and has a deep knowledge. Although I don’t know him
personally, but only by correspondence, I have a strong feeling that I
am talking to a gentleman from the 19th century - well-mannered, tactful
and friendly.</p>
<p>One of our first fights took place in 2018. I had known Dameo for
less than a year and tried to experiment a lot. I was still a ‘raw’
player, without style or understanding, but with a huge desire and
energy. Having watched a few of Ray’s games before this game, I realised
that he is a classical style player, preferring reliable structures with
traps a1-c1 and h1-f1 against the opponent’s king. So, I decided to
challenge such a strategy…</p>
<p><strong>1.g1-h2 e7-e5</strong> <strong>2.e1-g3 d7-d5</strong>
<strong>3.b1-a2 g8-h7</strong> <strong>4.d2-d4 d8-b6</strong>
<strong>5.c2-c4 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 1 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-001-9.png"
alt="Diagram 1" /></p>
<p>I won’t dwell on the first moves, as they can be almost any. The main
thing is the future plan. It was at this point that I decided to take a
radical step to try to throw my opponent off his equilibrium by any
means.</p>
<p><strong>5… c8a6?!</strong> <strong>6. d1g4 f8h6?!</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 2 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-002-12.png"
alt="Diagram 2" /></p>
<p>How to comment on these moves by Black? Any slightly experienced
player will see the obvious disadvantages and criticise it. Indeed,
Black is exposing its rear and burning all bridges. Once White gets a
king, it will be impossible to catch it on the 8th row.</p>
<p>However, such a development has a plus: Black has extra checkers in
the struggle along the entire clash line. I expected to suppress White
by the number of my checkers and supposed that this pressure will
compensate for all the disadvantages of my decision. For example, Black
already has a 5 vs. 3 advantage on verticals ‘a’ and ‘b’.</p>
<p>This plan, but only in a less radical form, I sometimes apply it
now.</p>
<p><strong>7.a2b3? b8a7</strong></p>
<p>The move a2b3 seemed a bit strange to me. On the contrary, playing
for White, I would try to block the vertical ‘a’ by e2b5! and c4:a4. But
White loses its sense of danger, allowing Black to create an attack on
the flank.</p>
<p><strong>8.h2f4 …</strong> (with the idea of f3f5) <strong>8…
e8g6</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 3 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-003-16.png"
alt="Diagram 3" /></p>
<p>Picture position! Black managed to get an advantage on the flanks,
and its square d6-e6-e5-d5 holds the defence in the centre.</p>
<p><strong>9.e2e4 a8a5</strong> <strong>10.b2a3 a5a4</strong>
<strong>11.a3:a5 a6:a4</strong> <strong>12.c3b4!? …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 4 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-004-23.png"
alt="Diagram 4" /></p>
<p>Black consistently carries out its plan and the flank attack already
looks threatening. Indeed, Black has an advantage in strength (6 vs. 5),
as well as freedom for manoeuvres and accumulation of forces. White is
constrained and clamped.</p>
<p>Realising that passive defence is unlikely to be successful, Ray
resorts to a desperate measure, risking to lose immediately, but builds
a trap…</p>
<p><strong>12… c7c5?</strong></p>
<p>It was played with the wrong piece! Believing that the position is
won almost automatically by attacking the checker c4, I played the
checker c7. I remember that I was afraid of some penetration on a6 and
left my checker on a7.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that it needed to protect not the a6
field, but the d7! My move looks very strong, but Ray blasts the
position with a landmine hidden in the depths of the board!</p>
<p><strong>13.d3b5!! …</strong></p>
<p>Oh, my God! What is that?</p>
<p><strong>13… с5:a3</strong> <strong>14.f3f5! …</strong></p>
<p>Where’s that coming from? What’s happening? I remember sitting there
like I was knocked out and didn’t understand anything.</p>
<p><strong>14… d5:h3</strong> <strong>15.f5:d7 …</strong></p>
<p>What’s the matter?! With a checker on c7, White’s combination would
not work!</p>
<p><strong>15… a4:c4</strong> <strong>16.d7c8 b6:b4</strong>
<strong>17.c8:c2 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-005-33.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<p>Well, an anomalous position has emerged on the board, where Black has
four checkers for a king, and also the dangerous checkers a3 and h3. The
problem is that White’s king is so strong that it doesn’t let Black’s
pieces even move because of constant hits with free tempo. For example,
Black attacks a checker, and White sacrifices it on the next move, and
in the meantime moves the king to the necessary place. Black is forced
to capture the prey, and White’s king destroys a large enemy force.</p>
<p>Threatens not only g4g5, but also at a chance c2a2, so the
countermeasure seems to be moves e6e5, h8h5 or g7g5. The choice is wide,
but it’s more difficult to make it. Let’s consider these continuations
in order.</p>
<h3 id="continuation-e6e5">Continuation e6e5</h3>
<p>I didn’t like the exchange e6e5 for the reason that Black creates its
own fragmented pieces. Against a mobile king this is almost always
wrong. For example, after</p>
<p><em>17… e6e5</em> <em>18.e4:e6 f6:d6</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 6 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-006-36.png"
alt="Diagram 6" /></p>
<p>I was afraid of this position, as I didn’t see a good defence against
19.c2a2. And only now in the analysis I found a refutation of this
manoeuvre.</p>
<p><em>19.c2a2? h6g5! (g7g5??)</em> <em>20.a2:a6:e6:h6:h2 g5:e1</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 7 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-007-40.png"
alt="Diagram 7" /></p>
<p>What a fantastic changing position on the board! A real kaleidoscope!
The black king dies on the next move, but so does the white king! If the
white king escaped, things would be bad for Black. Could it have been
foreseen in advance? The white king is suddenly caught in a trap and
Black wins! 0:2.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to diagram 6 again.</p>
<p>Diagr. 6 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-006-36.png"
alt="Diagram 6" /></p>
<p>And yet my intuition didn’t let me down. I rightly was fearing the
fragmentation of my pieces. White can use this disadvantage by a
crushing combination.</p>
<p><em>19.g4h5!! h6:h4</em> <em>20.h1h2! h3:h1</em> <em>21.c2d1
h1:e1</em> <em>22.d1:b1! …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 8 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-008-43.png"
alt="Diagram 8" /></p>
<p>Threatens 23.b1a2.</p>
<p>If 22… b7a6, then 23.f4e5 and White gets the second king and
wins.</p>
<p>Black can catch the white king after</p>
<p><em>22… b7c6</em> <em>23.b1a2 f7g6</em> <em>24.a2:h6 h7:h5</em>
<em>25.f4e5 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 9 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-009-49.png"
alt="Diagram 9" /></p>
<p>2:0.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the main point.</p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-005-33.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<h3 id="continuation-h8h5">Continuation h8h5</h3>
<p>This move looks stronger than the previous one. Indeed, Black keeps
compactness of its pieces on the flank and builds up pressure on the
line “h”. Now it would be disadvantageous for White to play c2a2
immediately, because this move should be made at the moment when the
king destroys more than 2 checkers of the opponent. Moreover, Black in
response threatens a counterattack from the g5 field, attacking White’s
3 pieces. The position on the board is extremely complex and full of
combinational possibilities. In my analysis I found a move</p>
<p><em>17… h8h5</em> <em>18.e4d5 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 10 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-010-35.png"
alt="Diagram 10" /></p>
<p>White threatens to get a second king by using the gap between the
opponent’s flanks. This is a very serious threat and for its realisation
you can even additionally sacrifice the checker f4e5. With 2 kings, you
can torture your opponent indefinitely. It is bad to play g7g5 because
of c2d1! and White responds by taking 6 checkers with a win. It is not
easy to find a worthy answer for Black, for example:</p>
<p><em>18… h6g5?</em> <em>19.h1h2! g5:e1</em> <em>20.h2:h8 e1:b1</em>
<em>21.a1:c1 a3a2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 11 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-011-42.png"
alt="Diagram 11" /></p>
<p><em>22.d5c6 a2a1</em> <em>23.f4g5! a1:h5</em> <em>24.h8:a8 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 12 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-012-47.png"
alt="Diagram 12" /></p>
<p>Black is too far behind in development, so in the future White with 3
kings has a great chance of winning. Immediately loses f7h5 due to a8a7,
2:0.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to diagram 10 and consider a stronger move</p>
<p>Diagr. 10 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-010-35.png"
alt="Diagram 10" /></p>
<p><em>18… f6g5</em></p>
<p>Now begins a spectacular shootout, like a cowboy action film.</p>
<p><em>19.d5d6! g5:e1</em> <em>20.d6:f8 e1:b1</em> <em>21.a1:c1
a3a2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 13 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-013-42.png"
alt="Diagram 13" /></p>
<p><em>22.f2g3 h3:f5</em> <em>23.f8:a1 a7a6!</em> <em>24.a1:c7 h7h4</em>
<em>25.c7:h7 h6:h8</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 14 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-014-50.png"
alt="Diagram 14" /></p>
<p>An incredible kaleidoscope of changing pictures again! This variant
demonstrates well the ideas and possibilities of the sides. So, after
the scuffle there was silence and both sides took a break.</p>
<p>I think of the poet Lermontov, who wrote the poem “Borodino” about
the famous battle between Napoleon and Kutuzov in 1812. One of the
bloodiest one-day battles in world history ended in the evening without
a clear winner and it was time to reflect on what had happened.</p>
<p>Here is a poetic translation of a fragment from that poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twilight descended. All were ready For dawn refight advancing steady
To last till death us mutes… Here drums-performed march hits the ear,
But enemy no longer near. It was good time to make wounds clear, To
fallen give salutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, in diagram 14, it is time for both sides to think hard about the
position. Tactical thinking must now give place to strategic.</p>
<p>Black’s task is to create a column of four checkers along the line
‘h’ and exchange the white checker on h1. In this case, the white king
will not be able to occupy the h1 square, as it will be immediately
captured, 0:2. Anticipating this, White should give up the h1 square,
but if the black king appears there, it must be destroyed immediately.
To do this, White should keep its c1 checker until the very end. As we
can see, both sides must act very precisely and carefully.</p>
<p><em>26.c2g2 h8g7</em> <em>27.g2h2 h5h3</em> <em>29.h2c2 g6h5</em>
<em>30.c2h2 g7h6</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 15 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-015-58.png"
alt="Diagram 15" /></p>
<p>Of course, there are some branches, and the order of moves may be
different. But it is important for us to see the final idea.</p>
<p>Black has built an attacking column, and the white king is in danger.
Then White surrenders the entire right flank and builds a defence on the
a1 square.</p>
<p><em>31.h2g1 …</em></p>
<p>You cannot move along the second horizontal line, because after h3g2
the white king is captured.</p>
<p><em>31… h3h2</em> <em>32.h1:h3 h4:h2</em> <em>33.g1d4 …</em></p>
<p>White can make any move that controls the a1 square. It is obvious
that the first black king will be captured, and the second king can only
appear after sacrificing one more piece. The result is a draw, 1:1!</p>
<p>Well, let’s look at the third continuation from diagram 5.</p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-005-33.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<h3 id="continuation-g7g5">Continuation g7g5</h3>
<p>Black with a tempo attacks white pieces and at the same time
threatens to catch the king by b7c6. What else can be demanded from such
a strong at first glance solution? I noticed a long time ago that in
abnormal positions simple logical moves do not lead to the goal, because
these kinds of positions require abnormal decisions :).</p>
<p>It would seem that the most obvious move g7g5, which most players
would make, is the best solution, but alas, White has an impressive
counter-punch from which goosebumps run down my skin.</p>
<p>Again, the move g7g5 exposes Black’s rear too much, in particular the
g7 square, and White emphasises this fact with a crushing
combination:</p>
<p><em>17… g7g5</em> <em>18.g4f5!! g5:e3</em> <em>19.g2f3! e3:g3</em>
<em>20.h1h2 h3:h1</em> <em>21.c2d1 h1:e1</em> <em>22.d1:a2 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 16 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-016-43.png"
alt="Diagram 16" /></p>
<p>This is how the weakness of the g7 square turned out so badly for
Black! White has a second potential king (f4), an extremely mobile king
on a2, and the a1-c1 trap. All these factors must lead to victory for
White, 2:0.</p>
<p>Of course, it is impossible to show all the moves and variations for
both sides from the position in diagram 5, as this would take up a lot
of space and time, but I believe the general picture is clear to the
reader. The second continuation h8h5 allows Black to keep the position
under control, but this only became clear as a result of analysis.</p>
<h3 id="continuation-of-main-line">Continuation of main line</h3>
<p>Let’s go back to the main flow of the game and to Diagram 5.</p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-005-33.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t see anything like this during the game. I got
scared and gave up on the above methods of defence.</p>
<p>But I had to find another line of defence! How did I reason? The
white king is very strong and to limit it somewhat, I should not create
weak fields in my camp, i.e. keep the checker massif compact. Besides, I
wanted to keep my a3 and b4 pieces at all costs to scare my opponent
with a breakthrough on both flanks.</p>
<p><strong>17… h6g5!</strong></p>
<p>This move is the straw I grasped at when diving to the bottom.
Indeed, Black does not weaken the g7 field, maintaining a monolithic
mass. Now all the above-mentioned combinations do not work. On top of
that, I’m preparing a stealth strike.</p>
<p><strong>18.g4h5 g7h6!</strong></p>
<p>An unexpected answer.</p>
<p><strong>19.h5:f5 h3h2</strong> <strong>20.h1:h3 g6g5</strong>
<strong>21.f5:h5 h6:h2</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 17 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-017-42.png"
alt="Diagram 17" /></p>
<p>Among other things, Black threatens to capture the king after b4c3.
Here, nothing gives White a combination</p>
<p><em>22.e4e5 e6:g4</em> <em>23.f2e3 h2:f2</em> <em>24.c2:a2 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-018-47.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p>If the white king had taken a different route and captured the b4
checker, it would be caught after b7b6. But of course, Ray would have
seen it.</p>
<p><em>24… b4b3!</em> <em>25.a2:a8 b3b2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 19 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-019-50.png"
alt="Diagram 19" /></p>
<p>and Black’s position is at least no worse.</p>
<p>Back to the main game and diagram 17.</p>
<p>Diagr. 17 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-017-42.png"
alt="Diagram 17" /></p>
<p><strong>22.f2g3 h2:f2</strong> <strong>23.c2:g2 …</strong></p>
<p>It’s an easily understandable exchange of a person who wants to feel
solid ground under his feet.</p>
<p>Diagr. 20 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-020-45.png"
alt="Diagram 20" /></p>
<p>I considered f7f5 here, but the attack on 2 pieces often leads to
trouble. White has a strong answer:</p>
<p><em>24… f7f5?</em> <em>25.e4e5! …</em></p>
<p>1.the 2x2 exchange</p>
<p><em>25… e6:g4</em> <em>26.g3:e5 b7c6</em> <em>27.g2a2 …</em></p>
<p>led to a quick victory for White due to the dispersed Black
forces;</p>
<p>2.the 1x2 exchange</p>
<p><em>25… f5:h3</em> <em>26.e5:e7 h3h2</em> <em>27.e7f8! h2:f2</em>
<em>28.f8:g2 …</em></p>
<p>2:0. I suggest the reader to calculate these variants in his
mind.</p>
<p>I decided to leave the move f7f5 in reserve, and in the meantime set
a small trap.</p>
<p><strong>23… b4b3</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 21 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-021-46.png"
alt="Diagram 21" /></p>
<p>Firstly, you shouldn’t despair, you should fight on! Secondly, Black
straightens the broken checker formation b4-a3, it will not allow white
king to destroy them with slalom. Thirdly, White’s active attack g3e5 in
view of e6d5 and f7g6 gives nothing to White, Black catches the
opponent’s king and threatens to get a king with material advantage.
Fourthly, I provoke my opponent to an attack</p>

<p>Diagr. 22 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-022-50.png"
alt="Diagram 22" /></p>
<p>If Black gets the king, White may lose. Maybe this fact frightened my
partner a lot and he refused to do it. But there was really nothing to
be afraid of!</p>
<p><em>26.a4d1! …</em></p>
<p>White potentially threatens to play c1c2, but so far the king is
caught. However, with g3e5 White can destroy the opponent’s position, so
I intended to play here</p>
<p><em>26… e6d5</em> <em>27.d1:g6 b2b1</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 23 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-023-54.png"
alt="Diagram 23" /></p>
<p><em>28.g6g8! b1:g5</em> <em>29.g8:g1 f7g6</em></p>
<p>Counting up to this position, I made sure that the white king is
still caught, but in the heat of the fight I didn’t realise that despite
Black’s material advantage, White wins!</p>
<p><em>30.g1:g8 h8:f8</em> <em>31.e4e5! …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 24 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-024-61.png"
alt="Diagram 24" /></p>
<p>White is very much ahead of the opponent in development and gets two
kings at once! Black’s position is lost, I suggest the reader to check
it by himself.</p>
<p>Thus, the direct attack 24.g2a2 with high probability led to White’s
victory.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the main diagram 21 again.</p>
<p>Diagr. 21 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-021-46.png"
alt="Diagram 21" /></p>
<p>Ray probably considered the move</p>
<p><em>24.g3e5 …</em></p>
<p>but saw that after</p>
<p><em>24… e6d5!</em> <em>25.e5:c5 f7g6</em> <em>26.g2:g8 h8:f8</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 25 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-025-52.png"
alt="Diagram 25" /></p>
<p>Black first gets a king and has an extra checker.</p>
<p>In the position of diagram 21 Ray had a quiet move f4e5. The
advantage of this move over g3e5 is that the vertical ‘g’ is not opened,
and the white king is not caught! After the answer h8g7 there will be an
exchange on the e7 square, this creates an extremely difficult game for
both sides, in which it is easy to make an unforced mistake. For
example:</p>
<p><em>24.f4e5 h8g7</em> <em>25.e5:e7 f7:d7</em> <em>26.g2a2? b7a6</em>
<em>27.a2:a4 b3b2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 26 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-026-54.png"
alt="Diagram 26" /></p>
<p>Suddenly it turns out that it is bad to play a4d1 because of b2b1,
and White is forced to capture the checker d7, clearing the way for the
black king, 0:2.</p>
<p>As we can see, in this edition the attack 26.g2a2 is ineffective and
should be limited to capturing space by 26.e4d5 with an extremely
complicated game.</p>
<p>But White missed this chance to fight for the win. It was
psychologically difficult to play under such a pressure of threats. Ray
wanted clarity and went for further simplification of the position.</p>
<p>Diagr. 21 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-021-46.png"
alt="Diagram 21" /></p>
<p><strong>24.c1b2?! b3:b1</strong> <strong>25.a1:c1 f7f5!</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 27 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-027-50.png"
alt="Diagram 27" /></p>
<p>Checkers a1 and b4 have disappeared from the board, so White’s
possibilities are sharply narrowed. But this should have been foreseen
in advance!</p>
<p>Without checker a1, the a2 field is inaccessible to the White king.
In addition, the black piece b4 made Black’s position lattice, and now
this piece is missing. For example:</p>
<p><em>26.е4е5? f5:h3</em> <em>27.e5:e7 h3h2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 28 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-028-54.png"
alt="Diagram 28" /></p>
<p>With checkers a1 and b4 White wins by simple e7f8 as shown above, but
in the position of diagram 32 only Black can win, as White has little
strength and few possibilities against the opponent’s offensive. I
suggest the reader to convince himself of this.</p>
<p>Let’s look again at diagram 27.</p>
<p>Ray had one last opportunity to continue the fight with a
combination:</p>
<p><em>26.f4g5! f5:h5</em> <em>27.e4e5 e6:e4</em> <em>28.g3f4 e4:g4</em>
<em>29.g2:a1 b7a6</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 29 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-029-58.png"
alt="Diagram 29" /></p>
<p>Learn to evaluate such positions without counting variants! White’s
task is to repel the attack on the two outermost verticals. To do it
move checker c1 to vertical ‘a’ and exchange it for 2 black pieces,
white king gets to the field a8 and controls from there the fields h1
and a1. If Black gets to h1, its king will die immediately after a8a1.
It seems to be a draw!</p>
<p>What if Black refuses to exchange on line “a”? Then White will get a
second king, which is only advantageous for White.</p>
<p>I’ll show the demo variant below for the sake of order:</p>
<p><em>30.c1b2 h8h6</em> <em>31.b2a3 h7h4</em> <em>32.a3a4 h6h3</em>
<em>33.a4a5 a6:a4</em> <em>34.a1:a8 h5h2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 30 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-030-68.png"
alt="Diagram 30" /></p>
<p>Then White makes any move with king controlling the a1 field.
Simplifying the narrative:</p>
<p><em>35.a8a2 h4h1</em> <em>36.a2a1 h1:e1</em> <em>37.a1:h1
h3g2</em></p>
<p>Draw! Well… That would be a fair result of such a battle!</p>
<p>Let’s go back to diagram 27 from the real game.</p>
<p>Diagr. 27 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-027-50.png"
alt="Diagram 27" /></p>
<p>Perhaps Ray simply did not see the continuation 26.f4g5. I think he
was very tired by this moment and was prone to make drastic
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>26.g2a2? …</strong></p>
<p>It is likely that this abrupt move is the crucial mistake.</p>
<p><strong>26… f5:h3</strong> <strong>27.a2:a8 h3h2</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 31 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-031-54.png"
alt="Diagram 31" /></p>
<p><strong>28.a8a2 …</strong></p>
<p>It’s already a surrender of all positions. Now White loses
immediately. Unfortunately, Ray didn’t have enough strength for the
whole game, especially such a tense and complicated one. Each of us has
our own limit, own ceiling, own peak. Perhaps Ray did not take into
account that the king on h1 attacks in two directions. The move 28.a8a1
prolonged the struggle, but did not save the game. In this case, Black
would first distract the king with 28…b7a6, and then play 29…h2h1,
attacking two pieces in two directions and getting a winning
endgame.</p>
<p><strong>28… h2h1</strong> <strong>29.a2b1 h1:e5</strong>
<strong>30.b1:b8 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 32 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-032-59.png"
alt="Diagram 32" /></p>
<p>Black’s material advantage is too great. Still was played:</p>
<p><strong>30… e6f5</strong> <strong>31.b8e8 e5e1</strong>
<strong>32.e8h5 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 33 <img src="chapters/Game02/LargeDiagram-033-63.png"
alt="Diagram 33" /></p>
<p><strong>32… e1:a1</strong> <strong>33.h5:d5 f6g5</strong>
<strong>34.d5:h5 h7h6</strong></p>
<p>White surrendered, 0:2.</p>
<p>Let’s summarise.</p>
<p>The game turned out to be extraordinarily complicated, but I believe
the reader could learn a lot, as I did.</p>
<p>My opening plan almost succeeded, but I thought that winning was
already easy, and Ray punished me for that with a brilliant combination.
After getting the king, White also had a great chance of winning, but I
woke up and started to fight back desperately. The position was full of
complex variants and perhaps suited my style more than Ray’s. With each
move my energy was rising and Ray’s was falling. My move 23…b4b3 had the
purpose to frighten the opponent and put pressure on his position. If
Ray had kept his cool, he could punish me a second time for my risky
style of play, but I was lucky. Another opportunity for Ray to put me in
big trouble was move 24.f4e5. To be honest, I don’t know how the game
would have ended then. Let it remain a little secret of our meeting.
White played better for the lion’s share of the whole game, but in the
end Ray didn’t have enough strength.</p>
<p>This memorable victory allowed me to get 1 point ahead of such
monsters as Busybee and Diamante at the last moment and take 1st place
in the tournament. Ray Garrison performed very well, taking the place
right behind us.

<p>Tony vs Beginner_2017 littlegolem.net Tournament:
draughts.in.DAMEO.92 2019</p>
<p>Game URL: <a
href="https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=2097149">https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=2097149</a></p>
<p>My opponent Tony specialises more in games such as Hex and Havannah,
in which he has achieved excellent results and won many tournaments.
Perhaps it explains his confident, straightforward and purposeful style
of play in Dameo. However, Dameo involves a lot of tactics, in which
Tony was less successful. Nevertheless, when playing against Tony, I
always felt somewhat uncomfortable, often got into unpleasant positions,
and frequently escaped by tactical means. The persistence and intensity
of our duels exhausted me to the limit in most cases. I believe that if
Tony had regarded Dameo with the same passion as Hex &amp; Havannah, he
would have been among the top five players in Dameo, and perhaps even
among the top three.</p>
<p><strong>1.e3e4 e6d5</strong></p>
<p>It’s a bizarre start, but each player is pursuing their own goals.
White chooses a somewhat wait-and-see tactic, depending on Black’s
moves. In Dameo, this is quite possible provided that the positional
play is competent. Yes, White is giving the initiative to his opponent,
but as long as there are many checkers on the board, this is not
critical. Black’s response shows that I am aiming for an asymmetrical
open position with a wide range of moves.</p>
<p><strong>2.e2e3 f6e5</strong> <strong>3.e4:e6 e7:e5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 1 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-001-6.png"
alt="Diagram 1" /></p>
<p>So, if we compare the advancement of the pieces on both sides, we can
conclude that Black is two tempos ahead of White in development. Is this
good or bad? It is impossible to answer this question at the beginning
of the game. The role of the development advantage increases as the
number of pieces on the board decreases. However, if the position is
closed, such an advantage often leads to ‘overdevelopment’ and a lack of
spare moves. Based on these considerations, Tony subsequently tries to
turn my trump card into my weakness.</p>
<p><strong>4.d2d4 g8g6</strong> <strong>5.d1d2 f7h5</strong>
<strong>6.b1e4 d7e6</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 2 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-002-12.png"
alt="Diagram 2" /></p>
<p>An important strategic moment in the game! I had a choice of which
path to direct the game, and I chose the path of closedness and
confrontation in the centre. Of course, there was another path,
connected with the move d8b6, which leads to the opposite game - open
and free.</p>
<p>How did I think at that moment? I rejected the second path, as it
seemed to me that exchanges would lead to the depletion of the game. But
I did not understand then that Dameo is not ordinary checkers and that
even endings of the type 3 against 3 simple checkers have a very sharp
character. Now I would try to open up the game and keep the initiative
in my hands, but at that time I had been playing Dameo for less than a
year and chose the first path. So, with the move d7e6, I fixed the
centre. My opponent’s left flank is weakened due to the absence of the
b1 checker, so it is not easy to organise the defence of this flank, as
the moves b1a2 or b1b3 are not possible. I organise an attack on both
flanks to force White to suffer from a lack of space.</p>
<p><strong>7.e1e2 …</strong></p>
<p>The checkers e2 and d2 usually serve against the oblique hits e6c4
and d6f4, but these hits are not yet possible. As White, I would have
preferred, without losing a single tempo, to immediately build a redoubt
on the left flank by means of c1a3 - b2b3 - c2a4. In this case, the wide
barricade d4-d3-c3-b3-a3-a4 would hold back Black’s attack. Next, I
would move the d2 checker to f4, obtaining a more or less harmonious
position.</p>
<p>However, Tony has his own thoughts on the matter. He plays simply and
confidently, hoping that a strong centre will allow him to repel any
flank attack.</p>
<p><strong>7… g7h6</strong> <strong>8.g2h3 h8h7</strong> <strong>9.g1h2
b8b6</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 3 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-003-18.png"
alt="Diagram 3" /></p>
<p>Black is harassing his opponent on both flanks. I am intimidating
Tony by capturing the h4 square, but I am actually planning an attack on
the other flank.</p>
<p><strong>10.h2h4 d8a5</strong> <strong>11.b2a3 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 4 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-004-21.png"
alt="Diagram 4" /></p>
<p>Here, I planned to play b7a6 and a6a4, but suddenly saw the exchange
a3b4. Thanks to the stronghold d4 White would use this kind of exchange
to extinguish Black’s initiative in this part of the board. At the time,
this discovery became a complete surprise to me, and I regretted that I
had engaged in a closed game with Tony (6…d7e6). Initially, I considered
disrupting White’s centre with e6f5, but it would be quickly restored.
Therefore, I decided to accumulate my forces on the flank.</p>
<p><strong>11… c7c5</strong> <strong>12.c2b3 e8d7</strong>
<strong>13.d2b4!? …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-005-25.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<p>Tony is provoking me to invade the light squares, but could this
really be advantageous for him? I have a choice: to capture the c4
square in three ways or to abandon it completely. It is important to
note that invading the c4 square leads to an attack on two pieces, not
just one!</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>
<p>It immediately became clear that it is bad to play e6c4, since after
the exchanges, the d6 checker is distracted, and Black ultimately
remains without a checker. I suggest that the reader verify this in his
mind.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>
<p>The move c6c4 also leads to material losses for Black due to the
simple b3a4. I didn’t want to look for salvation in a panic later, so I
focused on the third continuation.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3</strong></p>
<p><em>13… d5c4</em> <em>14.b3a4 c4:c2</em> <em>15.c1:c3! …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 6 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-006-29.png"
alt="Diagram 6" /></p>
<p>I planned to respond to the attack on the a5 piece with a
counterattack on the b4 piece by moving b7b5 or d7b5. However, it
quickly became clear that after exchanging the pieces on a5 and b4,
White uses the weakness of the d5 square and plays d3d5, achieving a
winning position. I suggest the reader see it in his imagination, and
below I will give the following variant:</p>
<p><em>15… b7b5?</em> <em>16.a4:a6 b5:b3</em> <em>17.d3d5 b3:d3</em>
<em>18.d5:b7 d3:d5</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 7 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-007-36.png"
alt="Diagram 7" /></p>
<p>White gets the king and wins. Move 15…d7b5 is slightly better, but
still leads to material losses due to the d3d5 manoeuvre described
above.</p>
<p>However, from Diagram 6, Black has a simple answer:</p>
<p><em>15… b7a6</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 8 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-008-30.png"
alt="Diagram 8" /></p>
<p>I did not see any dangerous continuation in this case, but I did not
like my position. Indeed, the weakness of the b7, b5 and d5 squares
should become apparent from the logic of the game. A player must have
intuition, an animal instinct that signals him what to do and what is
dangerous, where he can go and where he cannot. This quality must be
highly developed, otherwise it is impossible to become a good player in
any game. I was frightened by the move f3d5 and refused to go for this
whole Option 3.</p>
<p>I returned to this only in my analysis, without even suspecting what
awaited me.</p>
<p><em>16.f3d5 c6b5</em> <em>17.d5:f5 b5:b3</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 9 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-009-34.png"
alt="Diagram 9" /></p>
<p>The combination I discovered for White in this position made a
stunning impression on me! Let’s consider all the stages of my reasoning
so that the reader can follow the course of my thoughts. The black pawn
on b3 looks formidable, but on the other hand, White can use it. We
immediately see the move d3d5 with the idea of d5:b7, but unfortunately
for us, Black does not play b3:f3, but c5:g5. This fact is very
annoying, but we continue to dig deeper.</p>
<p>The unexpected move of the b3 checker to f3 provides excellent
starting opportunities for the white f2 checker. Let us keep this in
mind. Next, the f2 checker can only jump on dark squares, therefore, the
opponent’s checkers must be on light squares. Which checkers are these?
Firstly, it is the checker on the f3 square, whose route we have planned
in advance, which is b3:f3. Secondly, it is the checker on the f5 or g4
square. No black checker can land on the f5 square, but it can get to
the g4 square! Therefore, White can play h4g5 to build a route for the
f2 checker, which can capture the f3 and g4 checkers and land on the h4
square. Thirdly, we can extend this route by knocking out the h6 checker
via f5g6!</p>
<p>But, in my euphoria over this idea, I didn’t notice the pitfalls.</p>
<p><em>18.h4g5!! g6:g4</em> <em>19.f5g6! h6:f6</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 10 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-010-38.png"
alt="Diagram 10" /></p>
<p>But here I suddenly saw that the planned continuation</p>
<p><em>20.d3d5 b3:f3</em> <em>21.f2:h8 c5:g1</em></p>
<p>leads to a response strike from Black 21… c5:g1!</p>
<p>There arises a complex king ending with mutual chances, despite
Black’s extra piece. But it is not the goal that White was pursuing!</p>
<p>What should White do in diagram 10? Don’t despair, believe in your
plan!</p>
<p><em>20.d3f5!! b3:d5</em> <em>21.f5:f7 f8:f6</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 11 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-011-42.png"
alt="Diagram 11" /></p>
<p><em>22.e3d4 d5:d3</em> <em>23.e2e3 d3:f3</em></p>
<p>However much Black resisted, the b3 piece still got to the f3
square!</p>
<p><em>24.f2:h8 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 12 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-012-47.png"
alt="Diagram 12" /></p>
<p>What a remarkable situation! The white king is almost trapped, it’s
Black’s move, but… the king cannot be captured!</p>
<p>Black has three pieces against the king, but only White has a great
chance of winning. All of Black’s pieces are on their own half of the
board, and their path is very long and dangerous. The white king is
mobile, the first horizontal is well defended, and the piece on h3 is a
potential second king.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many moves in this position, so below I give an
illustrative variant that shows the insurmountable dangers for
Black:</p>
<p><em>24… c8f5</em> (What else can be done? Is there a better move?)
<em>25.h3g4 …</em></p>
<p>White wants to get a second king and prevents the invasion on f4
because of h8h2:</p>
<p><em>25…f6f4 26.h8h2 f4:d4 27.g4g5</em> - 2:0, the white king is
gathering a large harvest of black checkers; <em>25…f5f4 26.g4g5 f4:d4
27.g5g6</em>, 2:0.</p>
<p>In case of a careless 25.h3h4, Black had the answer 25…d7g4.</p>
<p><em>25… c5c4</em> <em>26.g4h5 …</em> (Threatens h5g6) <em>26…
f6g5</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 13 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-013-52.png"
alt="Diagram 13" /></p>
<p><em>27.h5h6 d7g4</em> <em>28.h6g7 g5g3</em> <em>29.g7f8 g3h2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 14 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-014-58.png"
alt="Diagram 14" /></p>
<p>Using the majority rule, Black still gets the king, but it’s
immediately captured.</p>
<p><em>30.f8:h4 h2g1</em> <em>31.h8h5 g1:e5</em> <em>32.h4:b8 a8:c8</em>
<em>33.h5:a8</em>, 2:0.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only one variant, but it reveals some of the
possibilities of the sides. Everything shown above does not exhaust the
numerous possibilities of the sides.</p>
<p>It is my deep conviction that Dameo is an element that is out of
human control. At the time of writing (2025), only the player Busybee
may have tamed this element. Each new generation produces its own
geniuses, and perhaps in 50-100 years, all the secrets of Dameo will be
finally revealed, and players will be able to calculate a colossal
number of options. But for now, we are like the explorers of the
Columbus era, only on a small board.</p>
<p>Well… let’s go back to diagram 5.</p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-005-25.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<p><strong>13… b7a6</strong></p>
<p>Black decided to patch up the holes in the light fields, agreeing to
completely close the flank. Now, after 14.b3b5 c8b7, I planned to build
a column along the “a” line and, with the help of the exchange a5a4,
invade my opponent’s camp.</p>
<p>But Tony played more cautiously. He decided to go into a solid
defense on his left flank and punish me for some “overdevelopment”.</p>
<p><strong>14.e2c4 d7b5</strong> <strong>15.a1a2 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 15 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-015-29.png"
alt="Diagram 15" /></p>
<p>Black removed the checker from square d7, with a potential diagonal
attack d6f4 in mind. However, Tony correctly assessed that this attack
was now bad, since afterward White responds with its own attack and
lands on square b7.</p>
<p><em>15… d6f4?</em> <em>16.d4:f6 f4:d2</em> <em>17.b3d5 b5:d3</em>
<em>18.d5:b7 …</em></p>
<p>Therefore, I am in no hurry and simply capture space, while Tony
closes the d2 square just in case.</p>
<p><strong>15… a6a4</strong> <strong>16.c1d2 f8g7</strong>
<strong>17.f2g3 a8a7</strong> <strong>18.f1g2 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 16 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-016-35.png"
alt="Diagram 16" /></p>
<p>The tension of the struggle grows with every move, and the price of a
mistake is too high. I had no desire to meticulously calculate the
remaining tempos, but I had already come to terms with this task.
Suddenly… f1g2. Here I wrote to Tony that I couldn’t play calmly anymore
and wanted to blow up this position, which reminded me of a hellish
boiler. Tony replied, “Go ahead, and welcome to hell!”</p>
<p><strong>18… d6f4</strong></p>
<p>This move and all subsequent hits should have led to Black’s defeat,
but it was impossible to foresee this.</p>
<p>The essence of this move is to clear the way for the checker …a4!</p>
<p><strong>19.d4:f6 f4:h2</strong> <strong>20.e4:e6 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 17 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-017-39.png"
alt="Diagram 17" /></p>
<p>Now comes the second diagonal strike, but… not right away!</p>
<p><strong>20… g6f5</strong></p>
<p>Can you imagine with how much inspiration such moves are made! I
couldn’t allow the move f6e7, after which it would be impossible to stop
the avalanche of white checkers.</p>
<p><strong>21.f6:f4 b6d4</strong> <strong>22.b4:d6 d4:b2</strong>
<strong>23.a2:c2 a4:a2</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-018-46.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p>I understood at that moment that sacrificing two pieces was most
likely incorrect, but I didn’t see any refutation. It was important for
me to get a non-standard position that suited my style better than
Tony’s. Well… I got what I wanted and expected a straightforward and
obvious continuation from White:</p>
<p><em>24.d6e7? a2a1</em> (this is stronger than h5g4 &amp; g7g6)
<em>25.e6e8 h2g1!</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 19 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-019-50.png"
alt="Diagram 19" /></p>
<p><em>26.e8:a4 g1:e2!</em> <em>27.d2:f2 a1:f1</em> , 0:2.</p>
<p>I remained in euphoria of my plan for many years, until I began to
analyse this position. Unfortunately for me, White has a clear win,
which proves that my idea to blow up the position had a flaw. But since
I put beauty in Dameo above all, I was not too upset, because White’s
counter-combination is no less beautiful and original than Black’s
previous moves.</p>
<p>I suggest readers look for the refutation themselves, and then see it
below.</p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-018-46.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p><em>24.h4g5!! h5:f3</em></p>
<p>Not every player will see this sacrifice. White uses the position of
the piece on h2 to its benefit! Material balance has been restored, but
now White knows Black’s next two moves and therefore has two tempos!
There is no defence against this.</p>
<p><em>25.d6e7 h2:h4</em> <em>26.e6e8 f3:h3</em> <em>27.e8:a1
h7h5</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 20 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-020-54.png"
alt="Diagram 20" /></p>
<p>The White position is, of course, won. It is quite enough to simply
play</p>
<p><em>28.e7f8 h3h2</em> <em>29.h1:h3 h4:h2</em> <em>30.f8f1 …</em></p>
<p>2:0.</p>
<p>Perhaps that would have been a beautiful ending to the game. Not all
creative ideas can lead to brilliant victories, like not every artist’s
work can become a world masterpiece.</p>
<p>What happened in our game with Tony next?</p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-018-46.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p><strong>24.g3e5? …</strong></p>
<p>I cannot blame Tony for this move, because many players would have
made a mistake in this unusual position. White wants to comfortably
conduct an attack and get many kings, but it wastes precious time. Tony
planned to distract my c8 checker with the sacrifice d6c7 so that his
future king would not be captured.</p>
<p><strong>24… h5g4</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I could have got the king straight away, but I didn’t know
which square to do it on (a1 or b1), so I made an unexpected move on the
other flank. At this point, my opponent decided not to waste any time
and rushed to the last horizontal, sacrificing a checker.</p>
<p><strong>25.e5e7 g4:e2</strong> <strong>26.d2:f2 a2b1</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 21 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-021-52.png"
alt="Diagram 21" /></p>
<p>Tony, of course, saw that I was capturing his king after 27.e6e8
b1a1, so he instantly played</p>
<p><strong>27.d6c7 c8:c6</strong> <strong>28.e6e8 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 22 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-022-55.png"
alt="Diagram 22" /></p>
<p>If White had gotten a second king without any trouble, it could have
turned the game around in its favor again, but I placed my king on the
b1 square not by chance.</p>
<p><strong>29… c5d4!</strong> <strong>30.d3:d5 c6c5</strong>
<strong>31.d5:b5 b1:b8:f8:f1</strong> <strong>32.e7d8 h2g1</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 23 <img src="chapters/Game03/LargeDiagram-023-62.png"
alt="Diagram 23" /></p>
<p>The storm swept through, taking all of the Whites’ hopes with it. But
the dream of the h2 checker to become king has come true!</p>
<p>Black has won the position in any case, because the two black kings
tear White to bits. Tony played</p>
<p><strong>33.c2c4 …</strong></p>
<p>The move d8h8 prolonged the resistance, but did not save the
game.</p>
<p><strong>33… a5b4</strong> <strong>34.c4:a4 g1g3</strong></p>
<p>0:2.</p>
<p>What conclusions can be made from our meeting? I rashly went for a
closed game and had to open up a position that I didn’t like. I gave up
two pieces, but got chaos on the board, as I wanted. Starting with
18…d6f4, I couldn’t foresee the counter-combination 24.h4g5, because I’m
still just a regular self-taught player, not a grandmaster :). Tony had
the opportunity to punish me, but he was confused by the wild position
and solved the problems in the usual positional way, when extraordinary
actions were required. In positional aspect, Tony looked better than me,
but in tactical aspect I was stronger, and this ultimately brought me
victory. <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"></p>

<p>Kirin vs Beginner_2017 play.abstractplay.com Dameo. Tournament Number
3. 2024</p>
<p>Game URL: <a
href="https://play.abstractplay.com/move/dameo/1/a2c4229c-4879-428e-a556-84abdfb8ac68?move=0">https://play.abstractplay.com/move/dameo/1/a2c4229c-4879-428e-a556-84abdfb8ac68?move=0</a></p>
<p>My first acquaintance with the player Kirin took place at the end of
2022. It turned out that he had read my book ‘Meet Dameo!’ and had been
captivated by this game. Our first training games showed that Kirin was
playing rather weakly at the time and lacked positional intuition and
tactical vision. He only knew the rules of the game and how the pieces
moved. However, I started out the same way. And so did another top-3
player, Mojmir Hanes, when he trained with me. Kirin’s leap in mastery
was remarkable. I quickly realised that I had to play with him at full
strength. His thirst for learning Dameo was amazing, and it seemed that
Kirin was ready to play day and night. If we take super grandmaster
Busybee as a bracket, then at the time of writing (September 2025),
Kirin is one of the top three Dameo players on the littlegolem.net
website. And he is the same player who only knew how the pieces moved!
Kirin’s example is a signal to any beginner in any game that with desire
and perseverance, it is possible to reach a high level. Don’t believe
it? See for yourself!</p>
<p><strong>1.c2b3 e6e5</strong></p>
<p>The move c2b3 may seem strange, but at the beginning of the game,
opponents have unlimited opportunities for development. Of course,
1.d1b3 or 1.b1b3 would have looked more harmonious, but the d1 and b1
checkers can subsequently occupy more advantageous squares than b3.
Black immediately notices the hole on the c2 square and threatens to
make an advantageous 3x3 exchange with e5e4 and d8d5, knocking out the
checker from the important a1 field. This threat is not at all fatal for
White, but in the endgame, the absence of a checker on the a1 square
could turn out to be a disadvantage. White prevents this for now.</p>
<p><strong>2.d3e4 g8g6</strong> <strong>3.e4:e6 e7:e5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 1 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-001-6.png"
alt="Diagram 1" /></p>
<p>So, the position has become open, and Black once again wants to use
the open field on c2. However, Kirin does not consider this exchange
dangerous for himself and begins to build up strength on his right
flank.</p>
<p><strong>4.e1g3 e5e4</strong> <strong>5.e3:e5 d8d5</strong>
<strong>6.e5:c5 c6:a2</strong> <strong>7.a1:a3 b8a7</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 2 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-002-14.png"
alt="Diagram 2" /></p>
<p>Despite numerous exchanges and the absence of a clear line of contact
between the forces, each of the partners is preparing for a fierce
battle. The fact is that Black has a slight advantage on the left flank
(5 against 4), while White has an advantage on the right flank (7
against 6). Each of us was confident in the strength of our attack and
the steadfastness of our defence. My move b8a7 hints at the beginning of
my assault, so Kirin, without losing momentum, launches a
counterattack.</p>
<p><strong>8.f2h4 g7h6</strong> <strong>9.d1g4 e8h5</strong></p>
<p>As can be seen, the piece d1 has found itself a more attacking field
than b3.</p>
<p><strong>10.g1h2 h5:h3</strong> <strong>11.h2:h4 f7h5</strong>
<strong>12.g2h3 b7a6</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 3 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-003-24.png"
alt="Diagram 3" /></p>
<p>The reader has already noticed that the author has not yet given any
variants in this game. Indeed, in an open position, variants are
useless, because the main thing is the plan. Now the forces of the
opponents are coming into light contact, and Kirin unexpectedly decides
on a risky move: he exposes his left flank in order to concentrate his
forces on the right flank. Apparently, Kirin believed that he would be
able to slow down Black’s attack along the line ‘a’ with small forces,
and that Black’s king would perish in the trap h1-f1. However, what will
White manage to do on the right flank?</p>
<p><strong>13.c1e3!? c8e6</strong> <strong>14.d2f4 c7e5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 4 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-004-28.png"
alt="Diagram 4" /></p>
<p>Black responds by building a defensive wall h5-h6-g6-f6-e6-e5 with
the safety net h8-f8. To break through this, White is forced to
sacrifice a checker, but Kirin resolutely goes on the attack.</p>
<p><strong>15.e3g5! h5:f5</strong> <strong>16.e2h5 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-005-31.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<p>Well, the time for general reasoning is over, and now it’s time for
the concrete details. I thought long and hard at this point and
initially planned to go for the continuation:</p>
<p><em>16… h8h7</em> <em>17.g3g5 f8g7</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 6 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-006-34.png"
alt="Diagram 6" /></p>
<p>Black still has an extra checker, but the strong connection on the
right flank clearly favours White. If the b3 checker were on e3, then
the move e3e4 would undermine Black’s structure. To this end, White can
play h1g2 with the threat of g2e4. For example, in the case of a
careless response</p>
<p><em>18.h1g2! d7d5?</em> <em>19.g2e4 e5:g3</em> <em>20.g5:e7
g3:g5</em> <em>21.h5:f7 …</em></p>
<p>we can talk only about a victory for White. I suggest readers
calculate this variant in their minds.</p>
<p>Since Black’s problem is in pieces e5 and d5, it is possible to try
sacrificing one of them:</p>
<p><em>18.h1g2! f5e4!</em> <em>19.f4:d4 d7d5?</em> <em>20.f1f2!
d5:d3</em> <em>21.h3f5 f6:f4</em> <em>22.f3:d7 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 7 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-007-43.png"
alt="Diagram 7" /></p>
<p>White not only gets the king first, but also threatens h4f6. 2:0.</p>
<p>Let’s return to diagram 6 again.</p>
<p>Diagr. 6 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-006-34.png"
alt="Diagram 6" /></p>
<p>What should Black do? I managed to find a more or less acceptable
defence plan only in analysis.</p>
<p><em>18.h1g2! f5e4!</em> <em>19.f4:d4 e6d5!</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 8 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-008-38.png"
alt="Diagram 8" /></p>
<p>Black should counterattack the isolated d4 piece with only this
checker. It is difficult to say whether it’s the strongest plan for
Black, but subsequent analysis shows that Black’s chances are still
higher. However, I repeat once again that many moves were found in the
analysis, but analysis and live play are completely different things.
What should White do now? Perhaps there is nothing better than
transitioning to an ending that is more advantageous for Black:</p>
<p><em>20.f1f2 d5:d3</em> <em>21.h3f5 f6:f4</em> <em>22.g4:c6 g6:g4</em>
<em>23.h4:f4 h6:h4</em> <em>24.b1c2 h4h3</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 9 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-009-48.png"
alt="Diagram 9" /></p>
<p>Although White has restored material equality, Black’s initiative is
very strong, threatening h3h2, and the exchange on f2 does not save
White, as the d3 checker breaks through to the 1st line. So White cannot
delay for a second!</p>
<p><em>25.f3f5! h3h2</em> <em>26.g2h3 h2:h4</em> <em>27.f4f6 h4h3</em>
<em>28.c6c7 d7:b7</em> <em>29.f6e7 h3h2</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 10 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-010-58.png"
alt="Diagram 10" /></p>
<p>Important point! What should White choose: to get the king
immediately or to lose the tempo f5e6, but get two kings? I suppose the
second option is worse, since after 30.f5e6 h2h1 31.e6e8 h1h2! White
suffers additional material losses, and the second king will not be
sufficient compensation for it.</p>
<p><em>30.e7d8 h2h1</em> <em>31.d8:d2 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 11 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-011-61.png"
alt="Diagram 11" /></p>
<p>This ending is most likely won for Black, but the path to victory can
be very long and requires maximum concentration from the player. I
myself have played similar endings for the weaker side and can confirm
that sometimes, with persistent defence, I managed not only to save
myself, but even to win! The fact is that the presence of kings on the
board dramatically increases the likelihood of tactical strikes from
both sides.</p>
<p>What strategy should both players follow in this position? Black’s
task is to take control of the 6th rank and try to break through on one
of the flanks. At the same time, exchanges are advantageous for Black if
they do not lead to a clear worsening of its position.</p>
<p>White’s task is to protect its active f5 piece, which will restrain
the black king. Thanks to its king, White must create constant tactical
threats.</p>
<p>Right now, Black has a huge choice of continuations - h1h6, h1d1,
h1c1, h1c6. Let’s consider at least the last of them.</p>
<p><em>31… h1c6</em></p>
<p>Black occupies the 6th row and attacks the c2 piece with a tempo. If
White removes the piece from the attack 32.c2a4 a6a5 33.a4:a6 a7:a5,
then it is not possible to block the flank with 34.b3a4? c6c8! 35.a4:a6
b7b6 36.a6:c6 c8:h2, 0:2. Try to visualise all of this in your mind.</p>
<p><em>32.d2g5 c6:c1</em> <em>33.g5:g8 c1h6</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 12 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-012-66.png"
alt="Diagram 12" /></p>
<p>Both sides achieved a small success: White activated its king and
destroyed the g7 checker, preventing the creation of an unpleasant
column of two checkers, h7 and h6. Black exchanged one pair of checkers,
increased its advantage on the flank (4 against 2) and reoccupied the
6th row.</p>
<p><em>34.g8g1 …</em></p>
<p>White moves its king to the first line with the intention of playing
g1h1 and tethering Black’s king to the h6 square. In addition, the white
king can be moved to the a1 square at any moment to help the left
flank.</p>
<p><em>34… a8a5</em> <em>35.b3a4 a7b6</em> <em>36.g1h1 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 13 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-013-71.png"
alt="Diagram 13" /></p>
<p>Black has not yet hindered White’s plans, but has simply moved
forward its flank. White blocked black pieces and occupied the excellent
h1 square with its king. But can you see the hit that Black has secretly
prepared? Try to find it yourself.</p>
<p><em>36… a6b5!</em> <em>37.a4:c6 h6:g2</em> <em>38.h1:h8 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 14 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-014-75.png"
alt="Diagram 14" /></p>
<p>Who would have thought that we would eventually get such an ending?
Black still needs to play accurately, and White must understand that any
exchange of 1x1 checkers will lead to defeat.</p>
<p><em>38… g2g6</em> <em>39.h8h6 g6g7</em> <em>40.f5f6 b7b6</em>
<em>41.h6h7 g7h8</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 15 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-015-82.png"
alt="Diagram 15" /></p>
<p><em>42.g7a7 b6b4</em> <em>43.f6g7 b5b3</em> <em>44.a7a2 h8a8</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 16 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-016-88.png"
alt="Diagram 16" /></p>
<p>0:2.</p>
<p>If 44.a7a8, then 44…b3b2, White captures the black king, but Black
gets two in return and wins.</p>
<p>Well… White is slightly behind in all variants. However, I did not
initially claim that Black should win, but only said that Black has a
better chance.</p>
<p>Of course, we couldn’t show all the variants, but limited ourselves
to only the most logical ones. The analysis showed to some extent that I
could have gone for all these continuations as early as diagram 5. But I
couldn’t see the super-precise moves and look so far into the
future.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the main flow of the game in diagram 5.</p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-005-31.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t really like ‘klinch’ positions, I prefer open
ones. But to get an open position, I have to blow up a closed one! How
can I do that in this case? White has one vulnerable square, and if I
can get there, it will be stunning! What is that square? You won’t
believe, but it’s the square… g2! Yes, you heard right, I plan to get to
the g2 square and get the king.</p>
<p>Such a crazy idea will come to mind only in a state of intense mental
excitement, but if you conjure over the board for a long time, this
state is sometimes possible…</p>
<p><strong>16… g6g5!?</strong></p>
<p>I hope my partner was shocked by this move.</p>
<p><strong>17.h5:h7 …</strong></p>
<p>Another capture of g4:g6 simply leads to a permutation of moves.</p>
<p><strong>17… h8:h6</strong> <strong>18.g4:g6 e6g4!</strong></p>
<p>That’s the crux of Black’s idea!</p>
<p>Diagr. 17 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-017-36.png"
alt="Diagram 17" /></p>
<p><strong>19.g6:c6 g4:g2</strong> <strong>20.f4:f6 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-018-39.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p>If Kirin sacrificed one checker to me before, then I am happy to
sacrifice three! As a result, White has two extra checkers, but now it
is Black’s turn!</p>
<p>Black has a choice of several continuations, but this choice is very
difficult.</p>
<p>20… g2g1 looks promising, but White can respond by capturing the king
with 21.f3f4, giving up four pieces and weakening the vertical ‘a’.
However, the black king still leaves the board. This move happened in
the game, so it will be shown below as the main continuation.</p>
<p>After the game Kirin wrote to me that he was afraid of the move 20…
h6h5, which would have destroyed the specified trap for the king.</p>
<p>It is possible to make a passive defensive move, 20… f8g7, blocking
the path of the white checker f6.</p>
<p>So, let’s start by looking at the last two continuations.</p>
<p><strong>Continuation 1.</strong></p>
<p><em>20… h6h5</em> <em>21.h4:h6 g2g1</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 19 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-019-42.png"
alt="Diagram 19" /></p>
<p>The black king attacks three white pieces, and White cannot
comfortably save its material advantage.</p>
<p>For example, 22.c6c7 g1:a5 23.c7:e7 e5f4 24.f3:f5 a5:b1, 0:2.</p>
<p>The same mechanism works after 22.f6e7 with the same result.</p>
<p>However, White can play more precisely:</p>
<p><em>22.b1a2! g1:g6</em> <em>23.h6:f6 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 20 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-020-45.png"
alt="Diagram 20" /></p>
<p>White sacrificed four pieces and captured Black’s king! Blocking the
a-vertical, superior development and quick getting of the king are
decisive factors in White’s favour.</p>
<p><em>23… f8g7</em> <em>24.h3h4 e5d4</em> <em>25.h4h5 d4d3</em>
<em>26.h5g6 g7:g5</em> <em>27.f6g7 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 21 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-021-53.png"
alt="Diagram 21" /></p>
<p>Black does not have time to get its king, because on d3e2 follows
g7g8 with an attack and control of the first row. Black is forced to
sacrifice the g5 checker by g5f4, but White gets a second king and
gradually wins. 2:0.</p>
<p><strong>Continuation 2.</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-018-39.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p>So, the sacrifice h6h5 does not save Black, although it does give
some practical chances, as White may make a mistake. Another reasonable
continuation is the calm move</p>
<p><em>20… f8g7</em></p>
<p>This was probably Black’s best chance, as White has a wide range of
moves, but not all of them lead to a clear victory.</p>
<p>For example, 21.f6e7 d7:f7 22.c6d7 e5d4! and Black overlaps row 4,
now the black king cannot be captured with the move f3f4.</p>
<p>The same mechanism works with 21.c6c7 d7:b7 22.f6e7 e5d4! Taking this
into account, White should play decisively and avoid unnecessary
complications.</p>
<p><em>21.h3h5! …</em></p>
<p>The h1 piece should be left in its place, as corner squares are often
key in the endgame. Therefore, the preliminary move h1h2 is not
necessary.</p>
<p><em>21… g2g1</em> <em>22.h5:f7 g1:a5</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 22 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-022-44.png"
alt="Diagram 22" /></p>
<p>Black is resisting as best it can: both e5f4 and a5d8 are
threatening. It’s better for White to get two kings right away:</p>
<p><em>23.f6f8 e5f4</em> <em>24.f3:f5 a5:a3</em> <em>25.f7e8 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 23 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-023-49.png"
alt="Diagram 23" /></p>
<p>Sacrifices and counter-sacrifices are popping up across the board!
Now White threatens to win instantly after c6b7 and e8b8.</p>
<p><em>25… a8a5</em></p>
<p>The black column begins to move, but it is too far from the first
row.</p>
<p><em>26.e8d8 …</em></p>
<p>White’s task is obvious: remove the d7 checker and clear the way for
the c6 checker to become a third king.</p>
<p><em>26… a3e7</em> <em>27.d8:d1 a7a4</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 24 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-024-54.png"
alt="Diagram 24" /></p>
<p>Black also makes the best moves - the 7th row is taken under control
and the road is cleared for the column. White must banish the black king
from the 7th line.</p>
<p><em>28.f8h8 a6a3</em> <em>29.h8h7 e7f8</em> <em>30.c6b7 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 25 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-025-59.png"
alt="Diagram 25" /></p>
<p>White’s position is won. In a broad sense, White can even give up two
kings for three pieces and get a winning 2-for-1 king endgame. Does not
save Black 30…f8h8 31.h7h3 h8:h2 32.h1:h3 a3a2 33.b7a8, 2:0.</p>
<p><em>30… f8a8</em> <em>31.h7h8 a8a6</em> <em>32.b7a8 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 26 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-026-63.png"
alt="Diagram 26" /></p>
<p>White firmly controls the first row, squares a1 and h1. This is
exactly how you should defeat the column! Black loses in all variations,
see for yourself.</p>
<p>2:0.</p>
<p>So, let’s return to the main line of play in Diagram 18 and see how
the struggle ended.</p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-018-39.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p><strong>20… g2g1</strong></p>
<p>This move offers White the opportunity to get the king after f6g7, as
Black is forced to capture g1:a5. After 21.f6g7 g1:a5 22.g7h8 d7e6, the
white king is captured, and Black gets a difficult but advantageous
endgame with an extra checker, but…</p>
<p><strong>21.f3f4!! g1:g4</strong> <strong>22.h4:f4 …</strong></p>
<p>If I gladly sacrificed three checkers, then Kirin easily gives me
four!</p>
<p>Diagr. 27 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-027-43.png"
alt="Diagram 27" /></p>
<p>So, Black once again has an extra piece, but White has a significant
advantage in development and a strong initiative. However, let us not
forget about the a8-a7-a6 column, which represents 2-3 potential kings.
This fact is pleasant for Black and a headache for White.</p>
<p>Therefore, Black immediately throws its column into battle.</p>
<p><strong>22… a8a5</strong> <strong>23.f6g7 e5d4</strong>
<strong>24.g7h8 d4c3</strong> <strong>25.h8:d1 c3:a3</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 28 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-028-50.png"
alt="Diagram 28" /></p>
<p>White can get a second king, but Black can get 3 or 4! Who is right?
In fact, it’s not that complicated. Let’s think schematically and not
count the variants. As soon as the first black checker reaches the a1
square, the white king moves to the f1 square, an exchange takes place,
and then h1:f1. The second black checker gets to a1, but by that time
White should already have a second king, which will control the h1
square. The second black king is captured, and the new white king moves
to a1 and blocks the two remaining black checkers. Black is forced to
sacrifice another piece, after which a king’s endgame arises with an
extra checker for White.</p>
<p>Kirin moved in to further separate Black’s lead checker from the
strong column following close behind. It makes little difference with
accurate play, but White has plenty of time and needs only to prepare
its second king on the long diagonal so it can restore the corner
trap.</p>
<p><strong>26.d1a4 a3b2</strong> <strong>27.a4d1 b2a1</strong>
<strong>28.d1f1 a1:g1</strong> <strong>29.h1:f1 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 29 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-029-57.png"
alt="Diagram 29" /></p>
<p>There is material equality on the board, and if Black could get at
least two kings, the game could turn in its favour. But the lag in
development is ruining Black.</p>
<p><strong>29… a7a4</strong> <strong>30.c6d7! …</strong></p>
<p>It seems more economical to play c6b7 immediately, going straight to
the a8 square, from where the white king could control the h1 square
without another move. In that case, however, Black may turn the game
around by leaving one checker of its strong column behind, for
example:</p>
<p><em>30.c6b7? a5a3!</em> <em>31.b7a8 a4a2!</em> <em>32.a8:a5 a2a1</em>
<em>33.a8:a2 a1:e1</em> , 0:2.</p>
<p>A connected column of 3 or more checkers can be very dangerous for a
king at any time. Kirin sees this and takes a slower but safer
course.</p>
<p><strong>30… a6a3</strong> <strong>31.d7e8 a5a2</strong>
<strong>32.e8e4 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 30 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-030-63.png"
alt="Diagram 30" /></p>
<p>White intentionally leaves the right flank as it stands, with two
checkers holding back one so it cannot disrupt the trap. Now it is clear
that Black is losing. Of course, I was very disappointed that it turned
out this way. I initially believed in the strength of my column along
the vertical ‘a’, but I underestimated the backwardness in the
development of my checkers.</p>
<p><strong>32… h6h5</strong></p>
<p>This move is my last hope. What if White impulsively moves forward
with the f4 piece? Then I sacrifice the h5 piece, distract the white
king and triumphantly invade a1… But the triumph will not happen.</p>
<p><strong>33.e4d5 a4a1</strong> <strong>34.d5h1 a1:g1</strong>
<strong>35.h1:a1 a3b2</strong> <strong>36.a1:a8 b2a1</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 31 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-031-72.png"
alt="Diagram 31" /></p>
<p>In Dameo, such endings are usually won, as two kings always catch
one. This is not particularly difficult for experienced players, but
less skilled players may also read these strings. Therefore, we will
comment on all the moves in our game.</p>
<p><strong>37.a8h8 a1f1</strong> <strong>38.h8:h4 f1:f6</strong></p>
<p>Now White’s task is to get a second king. Black can’t stop this in
any way.</p>
<p><strong>39.h4h8 f6g7</strong> <strong>40.h3h4 g7f6</strong>
<strong>41.h4h5 f6g7</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 32 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-032-82.png"
alt="Diagram 32" /></p>
<p><strong>42.h8a8 g7b7</strong> <strong>43.h5h6 b7d5</strong>
<strong>44.h6h7 d5e4</strong> <strong>45.h7h8 e4d5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 33 <img src="chapters/Game04/LargeDiagram-033-90.png"
alt="Diagram 33" /></p>
<p>Now White is building a position in which the two kings will
inevitably catch the opponent’s king.</p>
<p><strong>46.h8b2 …</strong></p>
<p>One such position is shown in my book ‘Meet Dameo!’. The two kings
are placed diagonally in the corner (in this case, on squares a8-b7 or
a1-b2), after which the lone king is captured on its move. Kirin chooses
the shortest path to this. Now there is a threat of a king sacrifice on
the b-vertical. Black has only two squares to escape this threat - d1
and h1. In the case of d5d1, a8a1 wins; if d5h1, then b2b7. See for
yourself by moving the pieces in your mind.</p>
<p>Black decided to finish the game immediately.</p>
<p><strong>46… d5e5</strong> <strong>47.b2b5 e5:a5</strong>
<strong>48.a8:a1</strong></p>
<p>2:0.</p>
<p>I struggled with my annoyance for a long time, but ultimately, does
it really matter in front of the beauty of such a game?!</p>
<p>Well… My idea with the move 16…g6g5 did not lead me to success. I
should have played more simply. Yes, perhaps by playing more simply, I
would not have lost this game, but then I would not have remembered it.
Having decided on the move g6g5, I passionately believed that the
a8-a7-a6 column would turn the game in my favour, and I was shocked when
Kirin curbed it. It was a powerful lesson that I learned. As for Kirin,
I wrote about his progress at the beginning. I hope the reader is
convinced of this and understands that it is possible with willpower,
desire, and intellectual passion. That’s how the learner surpassed the
teacher :).

<p>Another memorable meeting with Ray Garrison at the board. I tried
again to lure my opponent into a web of irrational play, but Ray’s clear
thinking led me to despair :). Steel was stronger than fire, but
suddenly help came from where no one expected…</p>
<p><strong>1.g2h3 d8b6</strong> <strong>2.g1h2 f8h6</strong>
<strong>3.b2a3 c7a5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 1 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-001-6.png"
alt="Diagram 1" /></p>
<p>Black’s last two moves look pretentious and eccentric. However, this
does not mean that I underestimated my opponent. On the contrary!
Knowing that Ray is a proponent of a clear style, I tried from the very
first moves to direct the game in an unusual course, because in Dameo
you can afford some freestyles at the beginning of the game. I decided
to be more economical with my checker placement. Yes, I could also
create my own column on the vertical ‘h’, but it would lead to a
completely closed game. Therefore, I planned to limit myself to blocking
the line ‘h’ with small forces in order to use the h8 checker in the
game. Of course, this was not the best decision, and I understood that.
But against Ray, I didn’t want to play ‘normal’ draughts. I will not
give any variants at the beginning of the game, but will limit myself to
general comments. The time for details will come later.</p>
<p><strong>4.e1g3 g8g6</strong> <strong>5.g3h4 e8h5</strong>
<strong>6.e2c4 b8b5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 2 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-002-12.png"
alt="Diagram 2" /></p>
<p>Ray responds to my extravagance with a move that is extremely strange
to me, e2c4. It would never have occurred to me to play like that!
However, these decisions of the players do not spoil anything yet, but
unconventional moves impose additional obligations on us in the middle
of the game. The c4 checker makes White’s entire left flank clumsy and
disharmonious, so I immediately begin active play there. When I capture
point a4, the white checker on c4 will facilitate my invasion of the b4
square. But is this really dangerous for White? I thought so. Ray was
convinced it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>7.a3b4 b5:b3</strong> <strong>8.c3:a3 b7b5</strong>
<strong>9.b1a2 c6a4</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 3 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-003-18.png"
alt="Diagram 3" /></p>
<p>Black has marked its intentions on the flank, trying to develop the
initiative there and grab space. However, White’s position is quite
reliable and some passivity is deceptive…</p>
<p><strong>10.e3d4 b6b4</strong> <strong>11.a2b3 b4:b2</strong>
<strong>12.c2:a2 e7c5</strong> <strong>13.c4:c6 d6:b6</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 4 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-004-26.png"
alt="Diagram 4" /></p>
<p>White’s four vertical columns look unusual, so Ray begins to build a
more harmonious structure. Black, in turn, launches an attack on its
right flank and also throws the h8 checker into battle. I go for broke
again, cutting off all ways back and trying to destroy the strict play
of my opponent. To do this, I want to involve all my checkers in the
game, counting on the fact that the passivity of the white checkers will
sooner or later turn in my favour.</p>
<p><strong>14.f2e3 d7c6</strong> <strong>15.f3e4 h8e5</strong>
<strong>16.d1c2 c8c7</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 5 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-005-32.png"
alt="Diagram 5" /></p>
<p>It seems the battle is beginning. My move c8c7 prepares for the
strike a5b4 at an opportune moment. But Ray demonstrates a remarkable
composure.</p>
<p><strong>17.d2c3 …</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I could play according to plan:</p>
<p><em>17… e5f4</em> <em>18.e4:g4 a5b4</em> <em>19.a3:c5 c6:e2</em>,</p>
<p>but a simple exchange</p>
<p><em>20.f1f2 e2:g2</em> <em>21.h2:f2 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 6 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-006-41.png"
alt="Diagram 6" /></p>
<p>would eliminate the dangers for White and simplify the game.
Moreover, the b4 piece is cut off from the main forces and may be
surrounded and attacked. I rejected this variant and decided to increase
pressure along line ‘b’.</p>
<p><strong>17… b6b4</strong> <strong>18.c1d2 b5b3!</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 7 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-007-36.png"
alt="Diagram 7" /></p>
<p>White made its next move quite quickly.</p>
<p><strong>19.d4c5 c6:c4</strong> <strong>20.c3:c5 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 8 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-008-39.png"
alt="Diagram 8" /></p>
<p>Ray sets me a little trap, counting on 20…e6d5?? In this case, after
two exchanges, White wins with the move c2c4. I suggest the reader to
see this for himself.</p>
<p>More reliable is 20…f7d5, which leads to Black’s initiative, but
after 20…f7d5 21.a3:c3 d5:b5 22.a2b3 b4:b2 23.c2:a2 White’s position is
fairly solid, and I wasn’t going to break my teeth on it.</p>
<p>I quickly rejected move 20…a5c3, as White has two comfortable capture
options with the prospect of later getting the king with material
equality.</p>
<p>I considered the move 20…b3b2 for a long time until I discovered a
tricky and interesting manoeuvre:</p>
<p><em>20… b3b2</em> <em>21.c5c6! c7:c5</em> <em>22.d2f4 b2:d4</em>
<em>23.e4:c6 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 9 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-009-45.png"
alt="Diagram 9" /></p>
<p>White gave up a piece, but will soon get a king.</p>
<p><em>23… f7f5</em> <em>24.e3d4! f5:f3</em> <em>25.d4c5 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 10 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-010-49.png"
alt="Diagram 10" /></p>
<p>Now White can get two kings, and that prospect made me feel bad
:).</p>
<p>Let’s return to the main diagram 8.</p>
<p>Diagr. 8 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-008-39.png"
alt="Diagram 8" /></p>
<p>White has one obvious weakness: a loose, unprotected centre. What’s
more, Black knows opponent’s next move! Note the piece on e5: it
connects White’s centre and has a potential route to the c1 square…</p>
<p><strong>20… g6f5!!</strong> <strong>21.a3:c3 b4b3</strong>
<strong>22.c3:a3 h5g4</strong> <strong>23.h4:f4 f5:f3</strong>
<strong>24.e3:g3 e5:c1</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 11 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-011-48.png"
alt="Diagram 11" /></p>
<p>The counterattack on the majority saves White from immediate
defeat.</p>
<p><strong>25.c5c6! c1:g6</strong> <strong>26.c6:c8 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 12 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-012-51.png"
alt="Diagram 12" /></p>
<p>So, Black has won a checker and can now think about a plan to realise
its material advantage. The worry didn’t come to me immediately. The
euphoria of a successful combination temporarily blinded me. Suddenly, I
realised that my king was trapped. Just h3g4 is threatening, and there
is no good defence!</p>
<p>In the case of 26…g6e4 27.d2e3! and 28.a3b4, Black is crushed.</p>
<p>Continuation 26…g6f5 27.d2e3! looks a little more persistent, but
here too, Black’s king has no peace. Indeed, look:</p>
<p>1.Moving to the vertical ‘g’ is not possible because of h2g3 &amp;
a3b4, 2:0.</p>
<p>2.Moving to the squares e5/d5 is also not possible because of the
sacrifice of the checker e3 and then a3b4, 2:0.</p>
<p>3.It is also bad to hide on b5 because of c8a6! and then h1h4! with a
powerful initiative for White, Black is late with the counterattack and
may lose.</p>
<p>Below is an illustrative example:</p>
<p><em>26… g6f5</em> <em>27.d2e3! f5b5</em> <em>28.c8a6! a5:a7</em>
<em>29.a3:c5 a7b6</em> <em>30.h1h4! h6g5</em> <em>31.h2h5 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 13 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-013-61.png"
alt="Diagram 13" /></p>
<p>Now it is clear how important it is to protect your edge verticals
from intrusion. In the case of an exchange on square f5, the black
checker lands on square f4 and is captured after h3g4, and White wins.
However, Black can set a trap!</p>
<p><em>31… g5f4!</em></p>
<p>Now 32.h3g4?? f7f5! 33.g4:e4 e6g4 34.h4:f4 f5:d3 is incorrect, and
the game turns in Black’s favour.</p>
<p><em>32.h4h6 f7f5</em></p>
<p>Now no tricks can save Black.</p>
<p><em>33.h5h7 e6g4</em> <em>34.h7:f7 f6:f8</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 14 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-014-68.png"
alt="Diagram 14" /></p>
<p><em>35.h6g7 g4g3</em> <em>36.h3:f3 f4:f2</em> <em>37.g7h8 …</em></p>
<p>Diagr. 15 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-015-73.png"
alt="Diagram 15" /></p>
<p>Black has tried to maintain material equality until the last moment,
but the position favours White in any case. White wins a checker and
gets a second king before its opponent.</p>
<p>2:0.</p>
<p>Well… let’s go back to Diagram 12.</p>
<p>Diagr. 12 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-012-51.png"
alt="Diagram 12" /></p>
<p>Intuitively sensing danger, I decided to retreat the king to h7. I
didn’t like this move either, because of the response c8h8, and the
black king is bound. However, I quickly calculated that with the moves
g7g6 &amp; f7h5, I would block the ‘h’ line and free my king.</p>
<p><strong>26… g6h7</strong> <strong>27.c8h8 g7g6</strong>
<strong>28.h2h4 f7h5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 16 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-016-56.png"
alt="Diagram 16" /></p>
<p>It seemed that Black had managed to avoid trouble and consolidate its
position, but Ray saw one step ahead!</p>
<p><strong>29.h3g4!! h5:h3</strong> <strong>30.g4h5 h6:h4</strong>
<strong>31.h8:h6 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 17 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-017-61.png"
alt="Diagram 17" /></p>
<p>Ray has finally broken through Black’s defences! Just recently, I was
looking for a win, but now I am forced to fight against the white king,
not knowing how it will turn out! He is now threatening h1g2 with the
blasting of the h3-h4 pair, so Black’s response is forced.</p>
<p><strong>31… g6h5</strong> <strong>32.h6f8 e6f5</strong>
<strong>33.d2e3 h3h2</strong> <strong>34.h1:h3 h4:h2</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 18 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-018-68.png"
alt="Diagram 18" /></p>
<p>At this point, I believed I was already winning, because 35.e3f4, as
well as 35.a3b4 a4:c4 36.e3f4 f5:f3 37.f8:a6 (it is not possible to
capture the f6 piece twice) does not save White.</p>
<p>But White’s next maneuver stunned me:</p>
<p><strong>35.a3b4 a4:c4</strong> <strong>36.f8h8!! …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 19 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-019-71.png"
alt="Diagram 19" /></p>
<p>This subtle move, which I didn’t see, saves White. I was still
looking for a win, but there isn’t one anymore. Black has three
responses: h5g4, c4d3, and h2h1.</p>
<p>I abandoned the move h5g4 because I lost my main hope - the h2
checker. Black will be forced to break through on White’s right flank,
opening the way for the e3 checker, which has a good chance of becoming
the second king. Perhaps a draw awaited us in this case, but Black would
have had no chance of anything more. And I was hoping for a victory!</p>
<p>In the second case, after</p>
<p><em>36… c4d3</em> <em>37.h8:h1 d3:f3</em> <em>38.h1g2 …</em></p>
<p>Black is forced to sacrifice two pieces in order to get the king. An
almost symmetrical position arises, which is also likely to lead to a
draw. But I don’t sit down at the board to play for a draw. I dislike
opening theory and the high percentage of draws in Chess and Draughts so
much that I clung to Dameo as a last resort to avoid all that.</p>
<p><strong>36… h2h1</strong></p>
<p>This risky move does not change the evaluation of the position, but I
wanted to continue fighting with the kings and expected to get a second
king with the help of the f5 pawn.</p>
<p><strong>37.h8:g6 f5f4</strong> <strong>38.g6g2 h1h8</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 20. <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-020-76.png"
alt="Diagram 20" /></p>
<p>This position attracted me. I intended to use pressure on the white
king to push my checker to the first row.</p>
<p><strong>39.e3d4 f4f3?</strong></p>
<p>This is a very, very heavy mistake and this weak move is already
losing. I didn’t immediately realise that I instead needed to organise
the move f4g3 and then g3h2. If I managed to do that, the white king
would be lost, and Black would have a good chance. White’s task would be
to prevent the move f4g3, for example:</p>
<p><em>39… h8g8!</em> <em>40.g2h3 g8h8</em></p>
<p>Then it is easiest for both sides to agree to a draw by repeating
moves.</p>
<p>What is wrong with the move f4f3? Answer: the white king can hide in
the corner h1 and remain there in complete safety; Black cannot attack
it.</p>
<p>This mistake can be explained by the fact that I was playing a dozen
other games in parallel in the tournament, so my brain protested :).
However, my opponent was in the same situation.</p>
<p><strong>40.d4e5 h8g8</strong> <strong>41.g2h1 f3g2</strong>
<strong>42.e5f6 …</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 21 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-021-83.png"
alt="Diagram 21" /></p>
<p>Black’s initiative and pressure came to a standstill.</p>
<p><strong>42… g8h8</strong> <strong>43.f6g7 a8b7</strong>
<strong>44.a2b3 b7a6</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 22 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-022-88.png"
alt="Diagram 22" /></p>
<p>I think we were both very tired by this point. Showing remarkable
resilience and composure, Ray fended off all my attempts to win and
forced me to making mistakes. How can White win here? Let’s think
without counting the variants.</p>
<p>White must reach square b7 with the threat of b7a8. Black cannot
respond in kind, as square a1 is occupied. Moreover, the b3 checker is
ahead of the a6 checker. White wins.</p>
<p><strong>45.a1b2 …</strong></p>
<p>This move does not spoil anything yet, as White can still prevent
black piece a6 from reaching square a1. Ray is simply losing 1 tempo,
but victory is still within his hands. But I sensed that my opponent was
losing control of the game or thinking he would win no matter what. With
a trembling hand, I tried to reproduce my next move on the screen and… I
couldn’t! The battery in my mouse had died. It was the end, but I set my
last trap.</p>
<p><strong>45… a6b5</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 23 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-023-90.png"

<p>Now move 46.b3a4 was winning, but something incredible happens…</p>
<p><strong>46.b2b4?? …</strong></p>
<p>This move can be explained either by fatigue or by tremendous nervous
tension. Remember: never attack your opponent’s checker when there are
kings on the board! You give your partner free tempo, and he will take
advantage of it. The tired Ray was probably counting on two responses:
46… b5a4? 47.h1g1, 2:0 or 46… h8b8? 47.b4:b6 b8:b2 48.g7g8, winning the
g2 piece and with it the game.</p>
<p>But Black has a third answer!</p>
<p><strong>46… h8g8!</strong> <strong>47.b4:b6 g8:a6</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 24 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-024-94.png"

<p>In Russian, Brazilian and International Draughts, this would be a
draw, but in Dameo such endings are won. First, Black gets a second
king.</p>
<p><strong>48.h1a1 a6f6</strong></p>
<p>Black takes control of square a1.</p>
<p><strong>49.a1h1 f6a1</strong> <strong>50.h1h8 g2h1</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 25 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-025-100.png"
alt="Diagram 25" /></p>
<p>One black king goes to its lower corner (this is the h8 field).
Second black king attacks a simple white checker from the rear.</p>
<p><strong>51.h8a8 a1g7</strong></p>
<p>But first, we must get the king a1 out of danger.</p>
<p><strong>52.b3b4 h1h8</strong> <strong>53.a8a1 g7b2</strong></p>
<p>Diagr. 26 <img src="chapters/Game05/LargeDiagram-026-106.png"
alt="Diagram 26" /></p>
<p>In the case of 54.b4a5, the manoeuvre h8h1 &amp; h1a1 wins, because
the white king and checker are bound, what leads to the loss of the
checker and a 2х1 winning endgame, 0-2. In the case of b4c5, the move
h8a8 with the main idea b2c3 wins, the white simple checker dies in any
case, see for yourself in your mind.</p>
<p>All this seemed clear enough to Ray, so White resigned.</p>
<p>0:2.</p>
<p>I won’t mind if someone says that I often get lucky in Dameo. Luck is
a very capricious and intangible thing, so each of us wants to deserve
its favour. Perhaps it likes my style of play. Perhaps I set my
opponents many problems, and they can’t withstand such pressure.
Sometimes I can’t endure it myself, and then Luck turns away from me
because I was weak and undecided in those moments. But it’s impossible
to be strong all the time, everywhere, isn’t it? Ray Garrison once again
outperformed me, but couldn’t follow through his excellent play.</p>
<p>Well… each of us has our own height, which we are incapable to
overcome. Otherwise, we would become gods…</p>
<p>Ray, thank you for the game!</p>
