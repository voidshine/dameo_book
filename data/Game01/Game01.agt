Busybee is probably the strongest Dameo player but he also has outstanding results in other games. For example, Busybee has a 100% win rate in such complex games as Shogi and Lines of Action. Of course, I would like to believe that he is a human and not a bot but unfortunately he hasn’t desire to start a dialogue or respond to a greeting. No problems, but it's a thousand pities. The point is that it is always nice to come across something unexplainable and genius, because it is an unforgettable experience for us ordinary people.\n\nOur meeting had everything: a very complex opening, inventive play from both sides, nonobvious mistakes and nonobvious punishment for them, and a cascade of combination hits.\n","LargeDiagram":false},"Version":20241021,"RulesName":"Dameo"}
