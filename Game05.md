Another memorable meeting with Ray Garrison at the board.  
I tried again to lure my opponent into a web of irrational play, but Ray's clear thinking led me to despair :).  
Steel was stronger than fire, but suddenly help came from where no one expected...

**1.g2h3	   d8b6**  
**2.g1h2	   f8h6**  
**3.b2a3	   c7a5**  

Diagr. 1

Black's last two moves look pretentious and eccentric. However, this does not mean that I underestimated my opponent. On the contrary!  
Knowing that Ray is a proponent of a clear style, I tried from the very first moves to direct the game in an unusual course, because in Dameo you can afford some freestyles at the beginning of the game.  
I decided to be more economical with my checker placement.  
Yes, I could also create my own column on the vertical ‘h’, but it would lead to a completely closed game.  
Therefore, I planned to limit myself to blocking the line 'h' with small forces in order to use the h8 checker in the game.  
Of course, this was not the best decision, and I understood that.  
But against Ray, I didn't want to play 'normal' draughts.  
I will not give any variants at the beginning of the game, but will limit myself to general comments. The time for details will come later.

**4.e1g3	   g8g6**  
**5.g3h4	   e8h5**  
**6.e2c4         b8b5**  
 
Diagr. 2

Ray responds to my extravagance with a move that is extremely strange to me, e2c4. It would never have come up to me to play like that!  
However, these decisions of the players do not spoil anything yet, but unconventional moves impose additional obligations on us in the middle of the game.  
The c4 checker makes White's entire left flank clumsy and disharmonious, so I immediately begin active play there.  
When I capture point a4, the white checker on c4 will facilitate my invasion of the b4 square.  
But is this really dangerous for White?  
I thought so. Ray was convinced it wasn't.  

**7.a3b4       b5:b3**  
**8.c3:a3	   b7b5**  
**9.b1a2       c6a4**  

Diagr. 3  

Black has marked its intentions on the flank, trying to develop the initiative there and grab space.  
However, White's position is quite reliable and some passivity is deceptive...

**10.e3d4	   b6b4**  
**11.a2b3      b4:b2**  
**12.c2:a2     e7c5**  
**13.c4:c6     d6:b6**  
 
Diagr. 4  

White's four vertical columns look unusual, so Ray begins to build a more harmonious structure.  
Black, in turn, launches an attack on its right flank and also throws the h8 checker into battle.  
I go for broke again, cutting off all ways back and trying to destroy the strict play of my opponent.  
To do this, I want to involve all my checkers in the game, counting on the fact that the passivity of the white checkers will sooner or later turn in my favour.

**14.f2e3      d7c6**  
**15.f3e4      h8e5**  
**16.d1c2      c8c7**  

Diagr. 5  

It seems the battle is beginning.  
My move c8c7 prepares for the strike a5b4 at an opportune moment.  
But Ray demonstrates a remarkable composure.

**17.d2c3       ...**  

Of course, I could play according to plan:  

*17...          e5f4*  
*18.e4:g4       a5b4*  
*19.a3:c5       c6:e2*,  

but a simple exchange  

*20.f1f2        e2:g2*  
*21.h2:f2       ...*  

Diagr. 6  

eliminated the dangers for White and simplified the game.  
Moreover, the b4 piece is cut off from the main forces and may be surrounded and attacked.  
I rejected this variant and decided to increase pressure along line ‘b’.

**17...        ...b6b4**  
**18.c1d2      b5b3!**  

Diagr. 7 

White made its next move quite quickly.

**19.d4c5      c6:c4**  
**20.c3:c5     ...**  

Diagr. 8  

Ray sets me a little trap, counting on 20...e6d5??  
In this case, after two exchanges, White wins with the move c2c4.  
I isuggest the reader to see this for himself.

More reliable is 20...f7d5, which leads to Black's initiative, but after  
20...f7d5 21.a3:c3 d5:b5 22.a2b3 b4:b2 23.c2:a2 White's position is fairly solid, and I wasn't going to break my teeth on it.  

I quickly rejected move 20...a5c3, as White has two comfortable capture options with the prospect of later getting the king with material equality.  

I considered the move 20...b3b2 for a long time until I discovered a tricky and interesting manoeuvre:  

*20...         b3b2*  
*21.c5c6!      c7:c5*  
*22.d2f4       b2:d4*  
*23.e4:c6      ...*  

Diagr. 9  

White gave up a piece, but will soon get a king.  

*23...          f7f5*  
*24.e3d4!       f5:f3*  
*25.d4c5        ...*  

Diagr. 10  

Now White can get two kings, and that prospect made me feel bad :).  

Let's return to the main diagram 8.  

Diagr. 8  

White has one obvious weakness: a loose, unprotected centre.  
What's more, Black knows opponent's next move!  
Note the piece on e5: it connects White's centre and has a potential route to the c1 square...

**20...        g6f5!!**  
**21.a3:c3     b4b3**  
**22.c3:a3     h5g4**  
**23.h4:f4     f5:f3**  
**24.e3:g3     e5:c1**  

Diagr. 11  

The counterattack on the majority saves White from immediate defeat.  

**25.c5c6!      c1:g6**  
**26.c6:c8      ...**  

Diagr. 12  

So, Black has won the checkers and can now think about a plan to realise its material advantage.  
The worry didn't come to me immediately. The euphoria of a successful combination temporarily blinded me.  
Suddenly, I realised that my king was trapped. Just h3g4 is threatening, and there is no good defence!  

In the case of 26...g6e4 27.d2e3! and 28.a3b4, Black is crushed.  

Continuation 26...g6f5 27.d2e3! looks a little more persistent, but here too, Black's king has no peace.  
Indeed, look:  

1.Moving to the vertical ‘g’ is not possible because of h2g3 & a3b4, 2:0.  

2.Moving to the squares e5/d5 is also not possible because of the sacrifice of the checker e3 and then a3b4, 2:0.  

3.It is also bad to hide on b5 because of c8a6! and then h1h4! with a powerful initiative for White, Black is late with the counterattack and may lose.  

Below is an illustrative example:

*26...          g6f5*  
*27.d2e3!       f5b5*  
*28.c8a6!       a5:a7*  
*29.a3:c5       a7b6*  
*30.h1h4!        h6g5*  
*31.h2h5        ...*  

Diagr. 13  

Now it is clear how important it is to protect your edge verticals from intrusion.  
In the case of an exchange on square f5, the black checker lands on square f4 and is captured after h3g4, and White wins.  
However, Black can set a trap!  

*31...          g5f4!*  

Now 32.h3g4?? f7f5! 33.g4:e4 e6g4 34.h4:f4 f5:d3 is incorrect, and the game turns in Black's favour.  

*32.h4h6        f7f5*  

Now no tricks can save Black.  

*33.h5h7        e6g4*  
*34.h7:f7       f6:f8*  

Diagr. 14  

*35.h6g7        g4g3*  
*36.h3:f3       f4:f2*  
*37.g7h8        ...*  

Diagr. 15  

Black has tried to maintain material equality until the last moment, but the position favours White in any case.  
White wins a checker and gets a second king before its opponent.  

2:0.  

Well... let's go back to diagram 12.  

Diagr. 12  

Intuitively sensing danger, I decided to retreat the king to h7.  
I didn't like this move either, because of the response c8h8, and the black king is bound.  
However, I quickly calculated that with the moves g7g6 & f7h5, I would block the ‘h’ line and free my king.  

**26...         g6h7**  
**27.c8h8       g7g6**  
**28.h2h4       f7h5**  

Diagr. 16  

It seemed that Black had managed to avoid trouble and consolidate its position, but Ray saw one step ahead!

**29.h3g4!!    h5:h3**  
**30.g4h5      h6:h4**  
**31.h8:h6     ...**  

Diagr. 17  

Ray has finally broken through Black's defences!  
Just recently, I was looking for a win, but now I am forced to fight against the white king, not knowing how it will turn out!  
He is now threatening h1g2 with the blasting of the h3-h4 pair, so Black's response is forced.

**31...        g6h5**  
**32.h6f8      e6f5**  
**33.d2e3      h3h2**  
**34.h1:h3     h4:h2**  

Diagr. 18  

At this point, I believed I was already winning, because 35.e3f4, as well as 35.a3b4 a4:c4 36.e3f4 f5:f3 37.f8:a6 (it is not possible to capture the f6 piece twice) does not save White.  

But White's next maneuver stunned me:  

**35.a3b4       a4:c4**  
**36.f8h8!!     ...**  

Diagr. 19  

This subtle move, which I didn't see, saves White.
I was still looking for a win, but there isn't one anymore.  
Black has three responses: h5g4, c4d3, and h2h1.  

I abandoned the move h5g4 because I lost my main hope - the h2 checker.  
Black will be forced to break through on White's right flank, opening the way for the e3 checker, which has a good chance of becoming the second king.  
Perhaps a draw awaited us in this case, but Black would have had no chance of anything more.  
And I was hoping for a victory!  

In the second case, after  

*36...              c4d3*  
*37.h8:h1           d3:f3*  
*38.g1g2            ...*  

Black is forced to sacrifice two pieces in order to get the king.  
An almost symmetrical position arises, which is also likely to lead to a draw.  
But I don't sit down at the board to play for a draw. I dislike opening theory and the high percentage of draws in chess and draughts so much that I clung to Dameo as a last resort to avoid all that.  

**36...         h2h1**  

This risky move does not change the evaluation of the position, but I wanted to continue fighting with the kings  
and expected to get a second king with the help of the f5 pawn.  

**37.h8:g6      f5f4**  
**38.g6g2       h1h8**  

Diagr. 20.  

This position attracted me.  
I intended to use pressure on the white king to push my checker to the first row.  

**39.e3d4      f4f3?**  

This is a very, very heavy mistake and this weak move is already losing.  
I didn't immediately realise that I needed to organise the move f4g3 and then g3h2.  
If I managed to do that, the white king would be lost, and Black would have a good chance.  
White's task is to prevent the move f4g3, for example:  

*39...        h8g8!*  
*40.g3h3      g8h8*  

It is easiest for both sides to agree to a draw by repeating moves.  

What is wrong with the move f4f3?  
Answer: the white king is hiding in the corner h1 and will remain there in complete safety; Black cannot attacks it.  

This mistake can be explained by the fact that I was playing a dozen other games in parallel in the tournament, so my brain protested :).  
However, my opponent was in the same situation.
  
**40.d4e5       h8g8**  
**41.g2h1       f3g2**  
**42.e5f6       ...** 

Diagr. 21  

The Blacks' initiative and pressure came to a standstill.

**42...         g8h8**         
**43.f6g7       a8b7**  
**44.a2b3       b7a6**  

Diagr. 22  

I think we were both very tired by this point.  
Showing remarkable resilience and composure, Ray fended off all my attempts to win and forced me to making mistakes.  
How can White win here?
Let's think without counting the variants.  

White must reach square b7 with the threat of b7a8.  
Black cannot respond in kind, as square a1 is occupied.  
Moreover, the b3 checker is ahead of the a6 checker.  
White wins.  

**45.a1b2       ...**  

This move does not spoil anything yet, as White can still prevent black piece a6 from reaching square a1.  
Ray is simply losing 1 tempo, but victory is still within his hands.  
But I sensed that my opponent was losing control of the game or thinking he would win no matter what.  
With a trembling hand, I tried to reproduce my next move on the screen and... I couldn't!  
The battery in my mouse had died.  
It was the end, but I set my last trap.  

**45...         a6b5**  

Diagr. 23  

Now move 46.b3a4 was winning, but something incredible happens...  

**46.b2b4??     ...**  

This move can be explained either by fatigue or by tremendous nervous tension.  
Remember: never attack your opponent's checker when there are kings on the board!  
You give your partner free tempo, and he will take advantage of it.  
The tired Ray was probably counting on two responses:  
46... b5a4? 47.h1g1, 2:0 or 46... h8b8? 47.b4:b6 b8:b2 48.g7g8, winning the g2 piece and with it the game.  

But Black has a third answer!

**46...         h8g8!**         
**47.b4:b6      g6:a6**  

Diagr. 24  

In Russian, Brazilian and international draughts, this would be a draw, but in Dameo such endings are won.  
First, Black gets a second king.  

**48.h1a1       a6f6**  

Black takes control of square a1.  

**49.a1h1       f6a1**  
**50.h1h8       g2h1**  

Diagr. 25  

One black king goes to its lower corner (this is the h8 field).  
Second black king attacks a simple white checker from the rear.  

**51.h8a8       a1g7**  

But first, we must get the king a1 out of danger.  

**52.b3b4       h1h8**  
**53.a8a1       g7b2**  

Diagr. 26  

In the case of 54.b4a5, the manoeuvre h8h1 & h1a1 wins, because the white king and checker are bound,  
what leads to the loss of the checker and a 2х1 winning endgame, 0-2.  
In the case of b4c5, the move h8a8 with the main idea b2c3 wins, white simple checker dies in any case, see for yourself in your mind.  

All this seemed clear enough to Ray, so White resigned.

0:2.  

I won't mind if someone says that I often get lucky in Dameo.  
Luck is a very capricious and intangible thing, so each of us wants to deserve its favour.  
Perhaps it likes my style of play. Perhaps I set my opponents many problems, and they can't withstand such pressure.  
Sometimes I can't endure it myself, and then Luck turns away from me because I was weak and undecided in those moments.  
But it's impossible to be strong all the time, everywhere, isn't it?  
Ray Garrison once again outperformed me, but couldn't follow through his excellent play.

Well... each of us has our own height, which we are incapable to overcome.
Otherwise, we would become gods...

Ray, thank you for the game!
