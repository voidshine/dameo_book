Dameo. Tournament Number 3.

[https://play.abstractplay.com/move/dameo/1/a2c4229c-4879-428e-a556-84abdfb8ac68?move=0](https://play.abstractplay.com/move/dameo/1/a2c4229c-4879-428e-a556-84abdfb8ac68?move=0)

My first acquaintance with the player Kirin took place at the end of 2022. It turned out that he had read my book ‘Meet Dameo!’ and had been captivated by this game.  
Our first training games showed that Kirin was playing rather weakly at the time and lacked positional intuition and tactical vision. He only knew the rules of the game and how the pieces moved.
However, I started out the same way. And so did another top-3 player, Mojmir Hanes, when he trained with me.  
Kirin's leap in mastery was remarkable. I quickly realised that I had to play with him at full strength. His thirst for learning Dameo was amazing, and it seemed that Kirin was ready to play day and night.  
If we take super grandmaster Busybee as a bracket, then at the time of writing (September 2025), Kirin is one of the top three Dameo players on the littlegolem.net website.  
And he is the same player who only knew how the pieces moved!  
Kirin's example is a signal to any beginner in any game that with desire and perseverance, it is possible to reach a high level.  
Don't believe it? See for yourself!



**1.c2b3	   e6e5**  

The move c2b3 may seem strange, but at the beginning of the game, opponents have unlimited opportunities for development.  
Of course, 1.d1b3 or 1.b1b3 would have looked more harmonious, but the d1 and b1 checkers can subsequently occupy more advantageous squares than b3.  
Black immediately notices the hole on the c2 square and threatens to make an advantageous 3x3 exchange with e5e4 and d8d5, knocking out the checker from the important a1 field.  
This threat is not at all fatal for White, but in the endgame, the absence of a checker on the a1 square could turn out to be a disadvantage.  
White prevents this for now.

**2.d3e4	   g8g6**  
**3.e4:e6	   e7:e5**  

Diagr. 1

So, the position has become open, and Black once again wants to use the open field on c2.  
However, Kirin does not consider this exchange dangerous for himself and begins to build up strength on his right flank.

**4.e1g3	   e5e4**  
**5.e3:e5	   d8d5**  
**6.e5:c5      c6:a2**  
**7.a1:a3      b8a7**  

Diagr. 2

Despite numerous exchanges and the absence of a clear line of contact between the forces, each of the partners is preparing for a fierce battle.  
The fact is that Black has a slight advantage on the left flank (5 against 4), while White has an advantage on the right flank (7 against 6).  
Each of us was confident in the strength of our attack and the steadfastness of our defence.  
My move b8a7 hints at the beginning of my assault, so Kirin, without losing momentum, launches a counterattack.

**8.f2h4	   g7h6**  
**9.d1g4       e8h5**  

As can be seen, the piece d1 has found itself a more attacking field than b3.

**10.g1h2	   h5:h3**  
**11.h2:h4     f7h5**  
**12.g2h3      b7a6**  

Diagr. 3  

The reader has already noticed that the author has not yet given any variants in this game. Indeed, in an open position, variants are useless, because the main thing is the plan.  
Now the forces of the opponents are coming into light contact, and Kirin unexpectedly decides on a risky move: he exposes his left flank in order to concentrate his forces on the right flank.  
Apparently, Kirin believed that he would be able to slow down Black's attack along the line ‘a’ with small forces, and that Black's king would perish in the trap h1-f1.  
However, what will White manage to do on the right flank?

**13.c1e3!?    c8e6**  
**14.d2f4      c7e5**  

Diagr. 4  

Black responds by building a defensive wall h5-h6-g6-f6-e6-e5 with the safety net h8-f8.  
To break through this, White is forced to sacrifice a checker, but Kirin resolutely goes on the attack.

**15.e3g5!     h5:f5**  
**16.e2h5      ...**  

Diagr. 5  

Well, the time for general reasoning is over, and now it's time for the concrete details.  
I thought long and hard at this point and initially planned to go for the continuation:  

*16...          h8h7*  
*17.g3g5        f8g7*  

Diagr. 6  

Black still has an extra checker, but the strong connection on the right flank clearly favours White.  
If the b3 checker were on e3, then the move e3e4 would undermine Black's structure.  
To this end, White can play h1g2 with the threat of g2e4.  
For example, in the case of a careless response  

*18.h1g2!       d7d5?*  
*19.g2e4        e5:g3*  
*20.g5:e7       g3:g5*  
*21.h5:f7       ...*  

we can talk only about a victory for White.  
I suggest readers calculate this variant in their minds.  

Since Black's problem is in pieces e5 and d5, it is possible to try sacrificing one of them:  

*18.h1g2!       f5e4!*  
*19.f4:d4       d7d5?*  
*20.f1f2!       d5:d3*  
*21.h3f5        f6:f4*  
*22.f3:d7       ...*  

Diagr. 7  

White not only gets the king first, but also threatens h4f6.  
2:0.  

Let's return to diagram 6 again.  

Diagr. 6

What should Black do?  
I managed to find a more or less acceptable defence plan only in analysis.  

*18.h1g2!       f5e4!*  
*19.f4:d4       e6d5!*  

Diagr. 8  

Black should counterattack the isolated d4 piece with only this checker.  
It is difficult to say whether it's the strongest plan for Black, but subsequent analysis shows that Black's chances are still higher.  
However, I repeat once again that many moves were found in the analysis, but analysis and live play are completely different things.  
What should White do now?  
Perhaps there is nothing better than transitioning to an ending that is more advantageous for Black:  

*20.f1f2        d5:d3*  
*21.h3f5        f6:f4*  
*22.g4:c6       g6:g4*  
*23.h4:f4       h6:h4*  
*24.b1c2        h4h3* 

Diagr. 9  

Although White has restored material equality, Black's initiative is very strong, threatening h3h2, and the exchange on f2 does not save White, as the d3 checker breaks through to the 1st line.  
So White cannot delay for a second!  

*25.f3f5!       h3h2*  
*26.g2h3        h2:h4*  
*27.f4f6        h4h3*  
*28.c6c7        d7:b7*  
*29.f6e7        h3h2*  

Diagr. 10  

Important point!  
What should White choose: to get the king immediately or to lose the tempo f5e6, but get two kings?  
I suppose the second option is worse, since after 30.f5e6 h2h1 31.e6e8 h1h2!  
White suffers additional material losses, and the second king will not be sufficient compensation for it.  

*30.e7d8        h2h1*  
*31.d8:d2       ...*  

Diagr. 11  

This ending is most likely won for Black, but the path to victory can be very long and requires maximum concentration from the player.  
I myself have played similar endings for the weaker side and can confirm that sometimes, with persistent defence, I managed not only to save myself, but even to win!  
The fact is that the presence of kings on the board dramatically increases the likelihood of tactical strikes from both sides.  

What strategy should both players follow in this position?  
Black's task is to take control of the 6th rank and try to break through on one of the flanks.  
At the same time, exchanges are advantageous for Black if they do not lead to a clear worsening of its position.  

White's task is to protect its active f5 piece, which will restrain the black king.  
Thanks to its king, White must create constant tactical threats.  

Right now, Black has a huge choice of continuations - h1h6, h1d1, h1c1, h1c6.  
Let's consider at least the last of them.  

*31...          h1c6*  

Black occupies the 6th row and attacks the c2 piece with a tempo.  
If White removes the piece from the attack 32.c2a4 a6a5 33.a4:a6 a7:a5,  
then it is not possible to block the flank with 34.b3a4? c6c8! 35.a4:a6 b7b6 36.a6:c6 c8:h2, 0:2.  
Try to visualise all of this in your mind.  

*32.d2g5         c6:c1*  
*33.g5:g8        c1h6*  

Diagr. 12  

Both sides achieved a small success:  
White activated its king and destroyed the g7 checker, preventing the creation of an unpleasant column of two checkers, h7 and h6.  
Black exchanged one pair of checkers, increased its advantage on the flank (4 against 2) and reoccupied the 6th row.  

*34.g8g1        ...*  

White moves its king to the first line with the intention of playing g1h1 and tethering Black's king to the h6 square.  
In addition, the white king can be moved to the a1 square at any moment to help the left flank.  

*34...          a8a5*  
*35.b3a4        a7b6*  
*36.g1h1        ...*  

Diagr. 13  

Black has not yet hindered White's plans, but has simply moved forward its flank.  
White blocked black pieces and occupied the excellent h1 square with its king.  
But can you see the hit that Black has secretly prepared?  
Try to find it yourself.  

*36...          a6b5!*  
*37.a4:c6       h6:g2*  
*38.h1:h8       ...*  

Diagr. 14  

Who would have thought that we would eventually get such an ending?  
Black still needs to play accurately, and White must understand that any exchange of 1x1 checkers will lead to defeat.  

*38...          g2g6*  
*39.h8h6        g6g7*  
*40.f5f6        b7b6*  
*41.h6h7        g7h8*  

Diagr. 15  

*42.g7a7        b6b4*  
*43.f6g7        b5b3*  
*44.a7a2        h8a8*  

Diagr. 16  

0:2.  

If 44.a7a8, then 44...b3b2, White captures the black king, but Black gets two in return and wins.    

Well... White is slightly behind in all variants.
However, I did not initially claim that Black should win, but only said that Black has a better chance.  

Of course, we couldn't show all the variants, but limited ourselves to only the most logical ones.  
The analysis showed to some extent that I could have gone for all these continuations as early as diagram 5.  
But I couldn't see the super-precise moves and look so far into the future.  

Let's return to the main flow of the game in diagram 5.  

Diagr. 5

To be honest, I don't really like ‘klinch’ positions, I prefer open ones. But to get an open position, I have to blow up a closed one!  
How can I do that in this case?  
White has one vulnerable square, and if I can get there, it will be stunning! What is that square?  
You won't believe, but it's the square... g2!  
Yes, you heard right, I plan to get to the g2 square and get the king.  

Such a crazy idea will come to mind only in a state of intense mental excitement, but if you conjure over the board for a long time, this state is sometimes possible...  

**16...         g6g5!?**  

I hope my partner was shocked by this move.  

**17.h5:h7      ...**  

Another capture of g4:g6 simply leads to a permutation of moves.  

**17...         h8:h6**  
**18.g4:g6      e6g4!**  

That's the crux of Black's idea!  

Diagr. 17  

**19.g6:c6      g4:g2**  
**20.f4:f6      ...**  

Diagr. 18  

If Kirin sacrificed one checker to me before, then I am happy to sacrifice three!  
As a result, White has two extra checkers, but now it is Black's turn!  

Black has a choice of several continuations, but this choice is very difficult.  

20... g2g1 looks promising, but White can respond by capturing the king with 21.f3f4, giving up four pieces and weakening the vertical 'a'.  
However, the black king still leaves the board.  
This move happened in the game, so it will be shown below as the main continuation.  

After the game Kirin wrote to me that he was afraid of the move 20... h6h5, which would have destroyed the specified trap for the king.   

It is possible to make a passive defensive move, 20... f8g7, blocking the path of the white checker f6.  

So, let's start by looking at the last two continuations.

**Continuation 1.**

*20...          h6h5*  
*21.h4:h6       g2g1*  

Diagr. 19  

The black king attacks three white pieces, and White cannot comfortably save its material advantage.  

For example, 22.c6c7 g1:a5 23.c7:e7 e5f4 24.f3:f5 a5:b1, 0:2.  

The same mechanism works after 22.f6e7 with the same result.  

However, White can play more precisely:  

*22.b1a2!       g1:g6*  
*23.h6:f6       ...*  

Diagr. 20  

White sacrificed four pieces and captured Black's king!  
Blocking the a-vertical, superior development and quick getting of the king are decisive factors in White's favour.  

*23...          f8g7*  
*24.h3h4        e5d4*  
*25.h4h5        d4d3*  
*26.h5g6        g7:g5*  
*27.f6g7        ...*  

Diagr. 21 

Black does not have time to get its king, because on d3e2 follows g7g8 with an attack and control of the first row.  
Black is forced to sacrifice the g5 checker by g5f4, but White gets a second king and gradually wins.  
2:0.  

**Continuation 2.**  

Diagr. 18  

So, the sacrifice h6h5 does not save Black, although it does give some practical chances, as White may make a mistake.  
Another reasonable continuation is the calm move  

*20...          f8g7*  

This was probably Black's best chance, as White has a wide range of moves, but not all of them lead to a clear victory.  

For example, 21.f6e7 d7:f7 22.c6d7 e5d4! and Black overlaps row 4, now the black king cannot be captured with the move f3f4.  

The same mechanism works with 22.c6c7 d7:b7 23.f6e7 e5d4!  
Taking this into account, White should play decisively and avoid unnecessary complications.  

*21.h3h5!       ...*  

The h1 piece should be left in its place, as corner squares are often key in the endgame.  
Therefore, the preliminary move h1h2 is not necessary.  

*21...          g2g1*  
*22.h5:f7       g1:a5*  

Diagr. 22  

Black is resisting as best it can: both e5f4 and a5d8 are threatening.  
It's better for White to get two kings right away:  

*23.f6f8        e5f4*  
*24.f3:f5       a5:a3*  
*25.f7e8        ...*  

Diagr. 23  

Sacrifices and counter-sacrifices are popping up across the board!  
Now White threatens to win instantly after c6b7 and e8b8.  

*25...          a8a5*  

The black column begins to move, but it is too far from the first row.  

*26.e8d8        ...*  

White's task is obvious: remove the d7 checker and clear the way for the c6 checker to become a third king.  

*26...          a3e7*  
*27.d6:d1       a7a4*  

Diagr. 24  

Black also makes the best moves - the 7th row is taken under control and the road is cleared for the column.  
White must banish the black king from the 7th line.  

*28.f8h8        a6a3*  
*29.h8h7        e7f8*  
*30.c6b7        ...*  

Diagr. 25  

White's position is won. In a broad sense, White can even give up two kings for three pieces and get a winning 2-for-1 king endgame.  
Does not save Black 30...f8h8 31.h7h3 h8:h2 33.h1:h3 a3a2 34.b7a8, 2:0.  

*30...          f8a8*  
*31.h7h8        a8a6*  
*32.b7a8        ...*  

Diagr. 26  

White firmly controls the first row, squares a1 and h1.  
This is exactly how you should defeat the column!  
Black loses in all variations, see for yourself.  

2:0.  

So, let's return to the main line of play in Diagram 18 and see how the struggle ended.  

Diagr. 18

**20...         g2g1**  

This move offers White the opportunity to get the king after f6g7, as Black is forced to capture g1:a5.  
After 22.f6g7 g1:a5 23.g7h8 d7e6, the white king is captured, and Black gets a difficult but advantageous endgame with an extra checker, but...  

**21.f3f4!!     g1:g4**  
**22.h4:f4      ...**  

If I gladly sacrificed three checkers, then Kirin easily gives me four!  

Diagr. 27  

So, Black once again has an extra piece, but White has a significant advantage in development and a strong initiative.  
However, let us not forget about the a8-a7-a6 column, which represents 2-3 potential kings.  
This fact is pleasant for Black and a headache for White.  

Therefore, Black immediately throws its column into battle.  

**22...         a8a5**  
**23.f6g7       e5d4**  
**24.g7h8       d4c3**  
**25.h8:d1      c3:a3** 

Diagr. 28  

White can get a second king, but Black can get 3 or 4!  
Who is right?  
In fact, it's not that complicated. Let's think schematically and not count the variants.  
As soon as the first black checker reaches the a1 square, the white king moves to the f1 square, an exchange takes place, and then h1:f1.  
The second black checker gets to a1, but by that time White should already have a second king, which will control the h1 square.  
The second black king is captured, and the new white king moves to a1 and blocks the two remaining black checkers.  
Black is forced to sacrifice another piece, after which a king's endgame arises with an extra checker for White.  

Kirin moved in to further separate Black's lead checker from the strong column following close behind.
It makes little difference with accurate play, but White has plenty of time and needs only to prepare its second king on the long diagonal so it can restore the corner trap.

**26.d1a4       a3b2**  
**27.a4d1       b2a1**  
**28.d1f1       a1:g1**  
**29.h1:f1      ...**  

Diagr. 29  

There is material equality on the board, and if Black could get at least two kings, the game could turn in its favour.  
But the lag in development is ruining Black.  

**29...         a7a4**  
**30.c6d7!      ...**  

It seems more economical to play c6b7 immediately, going straight to the a8 square, from where the white king could control the h1 square without another move.
In that case, however, Black may turn the game around by leaving one checker of its strong column behind, for example:  

*30.c6b7?       a5a3!*  
*31.b7a8        a4a2!*  
*32.a8:a5       a2a1*  
*33.a8:a2       a1:e1* , 0:2.  

A connected column of 3 or more checkers can be very dangerous for a king at any time.
Kirin sees this and takes a slower but safer course.

**30...         a6a3**  
**31.d7e8       a5a2**  
**32.e8e4       ...**  

Diagr. 30  

White intentionally leaves the right flank as it stands, with two checkers holding back one so it cannot disrupt the trap.
Now it is clear that Black is losing.  
Of course, I was very disappointed that it turned out this way.  
I initially believed in the strength of my column along the vertical ‘a’, but I underestimated the backwardness in the development of my checkers.  

**32...         h6h5**  

This move is my last hope.  
What if White impulsively moves forward with the f4 piece?  
Then I sacrifice the h5 piece, distract the white king and triumphantly invade a1...  
But the triumph will not happen.  

**33.e4d5       a4a1**  
**34.d5h1       a1:g1**  
**35.h1:a1      a3b2**  
**36.a1:a8      b2a1**  

Diagr. 31  

In Dameo, such endings are usually won, as two kings always catch one.  
This is not particularly difficult for experienced players, but less skilled players may also read these strings.  
Therefore, we will comment on all the moves in our game.  

**37.a8h8       a1f1**  
**38.h8:h4      f1:f6**  

Now White's task is to get a second king.  
Black can't stop this in any way.  

**39.h4h8       f6g7**  
**40.h3h4       g7f6**  
**41.h4h5       f6g7**  

Diagr. 32  

**42.h8a8       g7b7**  
**43.h5h6       b7d5**  
**44.h6h7       d5e4**  
**45.h7h8       e4d5**  

Diagr. 33  

Now White is building a position in which the two kings will inevitably catch the opponent's king.  

**46.h8b2       ...**  

One such position is shown in my book ‘Meet Dameo!’.  
The two kings are placed diagonally in the corner (in this case, on squares a8-b7 or a1-b2), after which the lone king is captured on its move.  
Kirin chooses the shortest path to this.  
Now there is a threat of a king sacrifice on the b-vertical. Black has only two squares to escape this threat - d1 and h1.  
In the case of d5d1, a8a1 wins; if d5h1, then b2b7.  
See for yourself by moving the pieces in your mind.  

Black decided to finish the game immediately.  

**46...         d5e5**  
**47.b2b5       e5:a5**  
**48.a8:a1**  

2:0.  

I struggled with my annoyance for a long time, but ultimately, does it really matter in front of the beauty of such a game?!  

Well...  
My idea with the move 16...g6g5 did not lead me to success. I should have played more simply.  
Yes, perhaps by playing more simply, I would not have lost this game, but then I would not have remembered it.  
Having decided on the move g6g5, I passionately believed that the a8-a7-a6 column would turn the game in my favour, and I was shocked when Kirin curbed it.  
It was a powerful lesson that I learned.  
As for Kirin, I wrote about his progress at the beginning.  
I hope the reader is convinced of this and understands that it is possible with willpower, desire, and intellectual passion.  
That's how the learner surpassed the teacher :).
